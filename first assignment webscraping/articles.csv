STOCKHOLM, Jan. 1 (Xinhua) -- Sweden on Sunday took over from the Czech Republic at the helm of the six-month rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU).
Sweden will hold the presidency for six months until June 30, 2023.
On Dec. 14, 2022, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson presented priorities of the Swedish presidency -- security, resilience, prosperity, democratic values and the rule of law. Kristersson told his country's Parliament that ""Sweden is taking over the Presidency at a time when the European Union is facing unprecedented challenges. A greener, more secure and freer Europe is the foundation of our priorities.""
In the field of security (or unity), the Swedish presidency will prioritize ""continued economic and military support for Ukraine, as well as support for Ukraine's path towards the EU,"" according to the government's website.
""The fight against cross-border organized crime will continue, responding to citizens' legitimate demands for safe and secure communities,"" it said.

In the field of resilience (or competitiveness), ""the EU must continue to provide the best possible conditions for a sound and open economy based on free competition, private investment and successful digitization,"" it said, adding that the Swedish presidency would seek to anchor a concerted approach to European competitiveness ""at the top of the political agenda.""
In the field of prosperity (or green and energy transition), it said that the Swedish presidency would continue efforts to tackle high and volatile energy prices while addressing long-term energy market reform.
The government also stressed the need to provide the right regulatory framework and policies to attract investments required for the transition to ""a resource-efficient, fossil-free future.""
And in the field of democratic values and the rule of law, the Swedish presidency emphasized the importance to uphold ""the principle of the rule of law and fundamental rights.""
Kristersson is scheduled to meet with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in the northern Swedish city of Kiruna on Jan. 13, when they would hold talks on relevant work plans during the Swedish presidency and issues that need to be resolved in the near future.
Sweden joined the EU on Jan. 1, 1995, and the country held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union twice before, respectively in 2001 and 2009.

PARIS, Jan. 2 (Xinhua) -- The systematic pre-departure or on-arrival testing of travelers from China for COVID-19 is ""neither scientifically justified nor risk-based,"" the Europe branch of Airports Council International (ACI EUROPE) said recently.
In a press release on Dec. 31, 2022, the organization expressed its ""regret regarding the actions of a number of states within the EU (European Union) and globally for unilaterally imposing health-related travel requirements.""
""These unilateral actions are at odds with all the experience and evidence gained over the past three years,"" it said, adding that ""these travel restrictions do not work.""

The ineffectiveness of international travel restrictions in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and its multiple variants of concern (VOCs) has been unequivocally recognized by both the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), ACI EUROPE noted.
According to the organization, as states need to remain vigilant to the status and control of the virus, the focus should instead be on increasing genomic sequencing to identify possible new COVID-19 variants and related surveillance.

""We are once again plunging back into a patchwork of unjustified and uncoordinated travel restrictions, which have no basis in scientific fact,"" commented Olivier Jankovec, director general of ACI EUROPE.

With its 90 percent COVID-19 vaccination rate, China's decision to reopen its borders is not irresponsible, he said. In most European countries the same decision was made when the vaccination rate was around 70 percent only.
BUDAPEST, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- A Hungarian expert spoke highly of China's reaction to the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic and said he was optimistic about the Chinese government's new anti-COVID measures.
""China reacted well in the early stages of the pandemic, when it stopped the spread of the virus with national lockdowns and mass testing, and began developing its own vaccines,"" Zoltan Kiszelly, director of the Center of Political Analyses at Hungary's Szazadveg Institute, told Xinhua in a recent interview.
China's health industry made a significant contribution to the global response to COVID-19 by exporting personal protective equipment (face masks, clothing) and syringes, according to Kiszelly.
The delivery from China to Hungary of hundreds of thousands of doses of the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine in 2021 greatly contributed to the rapid and mass immunization of the Hungarian population, said the expert.

It also helped Hungary to reopen after lifting the lockdown earlier than many other countries of Western Europe, he said.
The expert emphasized that in the early stages of the pandemic, China donated its own vaccine to allied third-world countries, which slowed the spread of the virus and helped the immunization of health workers and critical infrastructure workers.
Kiszelly also praised China for obtaining the World Health Organization's (WHO) authorization for its Sinopharm vaccine, which enabled people to freely travel in Europe.
It would be beneficial if the WHO, China, India, the United States, Russia and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) coordinated their licensing practices, he noted.

""I am optimistic about the Chinese government's pandemic prevention and control measures, as China can draw on the experience of other countries and regions, and the organization of the country, the discipline of the Chinese people, and the performance capacity of the Chinese economy provide the necessary tools, logistics and public cooperation for the new phase of the fight against the pandemic,"" he said.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- Members of a paralyzed U.S. House of Representatives reconvened Wednesday noon to elect a new speaker after a chaotic opening day of the divided 118th Congress.
U.S. Congressman Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, failed to secure enough votes on three ballots on Tuesday afternoon because about 20 House lawmakers of his own party picked other candidates for speaker.
It was the first time a House speaker -- who maintains order, manages its proceedings, and governs the administration of its business on the lower chamber's floor -- hadn't been elected on the first ballot in 100 years.
The fourth round of voting is underway. The 435-seat House will have to vote on and on until a speaker is elected with a majority of votes. Before that, members cannot be sworn in and committees cannot be formed with the rest of the business stalled.

McCarthy has the support of most House Republicans and former U.S. President Donald Trump but a handful of hardliners have opposed his bid to lead the conference by arguing that he is insufficiently conservative while refusing to decentralize the speaker's power.
Trump reaffirmed his support for McCarthy on Wednesday morning, urging Republican House members to elect him and not to ""turn a great triumph into a giant &embarrassing defeat"" in a social media post.

The House voted to adjourn until early Wednesday night for closed-door negotiations after U.S. Congressman Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, failed to secure enough votes another three times due to intra-party division.

The House has elected a speaker 127 times since 1789. There have been 14 instances of speaker elections requiring multiple ballots.
Thirteen of 14 multiple-ballot elections occurred before the Civil War, when party divisions were more nebulous, according to congressional historians. The last time a speaker election required two or more votes on the floor happened in 1923.
This time, all House Democrats have voted for Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, to be speaker.
Though it's unlikely for Jeffries to attain the position, he is set to become the first African American lawmaker to lead a party in either chamber of the U.S. Congress.

U.S. Apollo 7 astronaut Walter Cunningham dies at 90,"HOUSTON, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. astronaut Walt Cunningham, who flew into space on Apollo 7, the first crewed Apollo flight, died at 90 on Tuesday in Houston, according to a news release from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
""On Apollo 7, the first launch of a crewed Apollo mission, Walt and his crewmates made history, paving the way for the Artemis Generation we see today,"" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson.
Cunningham died of complications of a fall, his family said. A public memorial service will be held on Jan. 24 in Houston.
Cunningham, who called being an astronaut ""one of the world's greatest jobs ever,"" was a U.S. Marine Corps fighter pilot before becoming an astronaut in 1963 as part of NASA's third astronaut class.
He was designated the lunar module pilot for the 11-day flight of Apollo 7, which launched on Oct. 11, 1968 and was the first human flight test of the Apollo spacecraft. With Walter Schirra and Donn Eisele, he tested maneuvers necessary for docking and lunar orbit rendezvous using the third stage of their Saturn IB launch vehicle, according to NASA.
The crew successfully completed eight tests, igniting the service module engine, measuring the accuracy of performance of all spacecraft systems, and providing the first live television transmission of onboard crew activities. The 263-hour and 4.5-million-mile flight splashed down on Oct. 22, 1968 in the Atlantic Ocean.
""Walt Cunningham was a fighter pilot, physicist, and an entrepreneur -- but, above all, he was an explorer,"" Nelson said. ""NASA will always remember his contributions to our nation's space program and sends our condolences to the Cunningham family.""
""The world has lost another true hero, and we will miss him dearly,"" the Cunningham family said in a statement.
Born on March 16, 1932, Cunningham received a bachelor of arts with honors in physics in 1960 and a master of arts with distinction in physics in 1961 from the University of California at Los Angeles. He then completed a doctorate in physics with exception of thesis at the Advanced Management Program in the Harvard Business School in 1974.
He joined the U.S. Navy in 1951 and served on active duty with the U.S. Marine Corps, retiring with the rank of colonel. He has accumulated more than 4,500 hours of flying time in 40 different aircraft, including more than 3,400 in jet aircraft.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of Representatives adjourned on Tuesday evening after its members failed to elect a speaker for the lower chamber.
U.S. Congressman Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, failed to secure enough votes in three ballots earlier in the day after a group of House Republicans voted against him.
There will be at least a fourth vote as House members agreed to adjourn until Wednesday noon. McCarthy is reportedly negotiating with fellow Republicans on Tuesday night.
The political drama came nearly two months after the 2022 midterm elections, in which Republicans flipped the House and Democrats held onto their majority in the Senate.
HISTORICALLY DIVIDED CONGRESS
This was the first time in a century that the U.S. House speaker was not elected on the first ballot.
The House will have to vote on and on until a speaker is elected with a majority of votes. A candidate needs 218 votes to become speaker if no lawmaker skips the vote or votes ""present.""
All House Democrats voted for Congressman Hakeem Jeffries from New York to lead the Democratic minority in the three rounds of voting on the speakership.
It also followed the convening of the new and divided Congress on Tuesday noon.
Jemele Hill, a contributing writer for The Atlantic, tweeted on Tuesday afternoon that ""what we're witnessing today in American politics is just another brutal indictment of this dysfunctional political system.""
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that U.S. President Joe Biden, a former six-term senator from Delaware, ""will not insert himself in that process.""

""The president served as a U.S. senator for 34 years and he understands how this process works,"" Jean-Pierre said.
U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris presided over the opening day of the Senate -- where Democrats have a slim 51-49 majority over Republicans -- when she swore in 35 either newly elected or reelected senators Tuesday afternoon.
Chuck Schumer from New York and Mitch McConnell from Kentucky, both Senate veterans, remain the chamber's majority leader and minority leader, respectively.
PUBLIC TRUST IN CONGRESS AT LOW LEVEL
U.S. Congressman-elect George Santos, a 34-year-old Republican from New York, is among those who are waiting to be sworn in after the speaker vote.
Santos has recently admitted to lying about his educational history and professional biography but rejected bipartisan calls for him not to take office.
""My sins here are embellishing my resume. I'm sorry,"" embattled Santos acknowledged last week while alleging that the controversy would not deter him ""from having good legislative success.""
Former U.S. Congresswoman and Fox News contributor Tulsi Gabbard commented, ""Washington has created a culture where it's acceptable to lie to further your own interest.""
""But even when politicians do get caught, people just shrug their shoulders and move on,"" Gabbard continued. ""So, no one should be surprised that the American people don't trust these politicians.""
Public trust in the U.S. Congress reached an all-time low, with only 7 percent of Americans expressing ""a great deal"" or ""quite a lot"" of confidence in it, according to a Gallup poll released in the summer of 2022.
A separate survey that Gallup conducted following last year's midterm elections suggested that Americans' approval of Congress remains largely negative, with 73 percent of U.S. adults expressing disapproval.
The divided Congress with Republicans controlling the House is likely to stall Biden's legislative agenda in the next two years.
In addition, top House Republicans have vowed to launch a series of investigations into the Democratic administration, poised to augment partisan discord on Capitol Hill.
""Our politics has gotten so angry, so mean, so partisan,"" Biden said late last year. ""And too often we see each other as enemies, not as neighbors; as Democrats or Republicans, not as fellow Americans. We've become too divided.""

TEHRAN, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranians gathered on Tuesday across the country to remember former commander Qassem Soleimani who was assassinated by the United States in January 2020.
During a ceremony marking the 3rd anniversary of Soleimani's assassination in the capital Tehran, the crowds waved Iranian flags and chanted anti-American slogans.
""We have not forgotten and will not forget about avenging the top commander's blood,"" Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi told the crowds, describing Soleimani as the symbol of the fight against oppression and global arrogance.

Similar ceremonies were also held in the cities of Esfahan, Yazd and Soleimani's hometown Kerman.
On Jan. 3, 2020, the U.S. military assassinated Soleimani and the deputy commander of Iraq's paramilitary Hashd Shaabi forces Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in a drone strike near the Baghdad International Airport in Iraq. The assassination was condemned by Iran as an act of ""state terrorism.""

Mexican president pledges to urge U.S. to end interventionist policy,"MEXICO CITY, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Tuesday said he will at a summit urge the U.S. government to end the interventionist Monroe Doctrine it has followed for the past 200 years.
As the host of the North American Leaders' Summit next week, Lopez Obrador is set to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau here in the Mexican capital.
Lopez Obrador plans to call on Biden to change the U.S. policy of ""intervening in"" countries throughout the Americas in a bid to dominate the Western Hemisphere.
The Monroe Doctrine, formulated in the early 1800s by then U.S. President James Monroe, ""has been in place for 200 years,"" he told reporters during his daily press conference at the National Palace in Mexico City.
The principle deems any intervention by external powers in the politics of the Americas as a potentially hostile act against the United States, and has been giving Washington reasons to exercise control over Latin America.
""Respect the autonomy and self-determination of the peoples. It is a very important change,"" said Lopez Obrador.
He also aims to propose integrating North America with the rest of the Western Hemisphere economically to promote development and tackle immigration.

Iraqi protesters blast U.S. for violating sovereignty on 3rd anniversary of deadly drone strike,"BAGHDAD, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraqis on Tuesday rallied to mark the third anniversary of the assassination of two Iraqi and Iranian commanders in a U.S. drone attack, condemning the U.S. terror act and its violation of Iraqi sovereignty.
On the al-Tahrir Square in the capital Baghdad, scores of Iraqis held high the pictures of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy chief of Iraq's paramilitary Hashd Shaabi forces, and Qassem Soleimani, former commander of the Quds Force of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC).
Both Soleimani and al-Muhandis, who played important roles in the war against the extremist Islamic State (IS) militants, were assassinated in the U.S. drone attack on a convoy of vehicles near the Baghdad International Airport on Jan. 3, 2020.
The Iraqi protesters denounced the United States for creating chaos or disasters in Iraq, which was invaded by the U.S. forces in 2003, and even all over the world in the name of ""protecting human rights.""
""They (Americans) target a leader inside our country. (Therefore) there is no sovereignty. Not even the airspace belongs to Iraq. They (U.S. aircraft) enter our airspace and strike our leaders,"" Ahmed Kadhim, a fitness trainer, told Xinhua.
He said the airstrike was a flagrant violation of Iraq's sovereignty, stressing that the United States is an ""undemocratic and inhumane country"".
""America is the creator of terrorism, and it is the country of chaos and wants to spread chaos all over the world,"" Kadhim added.
Sadid Abdul-Ghani, a retired government employee, told Xinhua that the illegal airstrike that assassinated Soleimani and al-Muhandis was a flagrant violation of Iraq's sovereignty, Iraqis' human rights and all international laws.
""This is a painful terrorist act ... It violates human rights in this airstrike and in other acts"" that spread terrorism in Iraq and other countries, Abdul-Ghani said.
He said the United States has been bringing about chaos, internal fight, instability and economic crisis to Iraq and other countries. ""By this airstrike, the United States aimed to dominate Iraq and the region and to control the world,"" he added.
Ahmed Salim, a Baghdad resident, condemned the U.S. airstrike that killed Soleimani and al-Muhandis, saying Washington ""wanted to dominate Iraq.""
""It claims that it fights terrorism, but it committed a terrorist crime at dawn on Jan. 3, 2020,"" he said.
Also on Tuesday, the Iraqi Hashd Shaabi held a memorial service at the site of the airstrike on a road near the Baghdad International Airport, which was attended by many Iraqis.
""The enemies were disappointed, as they thought that by making people absent and killing leaders, the will of nations would be broken, but they missed that the martyrs are the makers of the glory of every nation,"" Falih al-Fayyadh, head of the Hashd Shaabi commission, said in a speech.
""The assassination of the two leaders, al-Muhandis and Soleimani, was orchestrated by (former U.S. President Donald) Trump, but it will not be long before we see him in the dustbin of history,"" al-Fayyadh added.
Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' al-Sudani said in a tweet that ""it is necessary to recall the leaders of victory and their heroism in confronting the most violent extremist terrorist group (IS) known to our contemporary history.""
He said the assassination of the two leaders motivated the Iraqi government to work to ""consolidate sovereignty and work for an Iraq that is independent in its policies and capable of protecting its people.""
The U.S. airstrike that killed Soleimani and al-Muhandis sparked tension and reprisal attacks between Iran and the United States on Iraqi soil.
Two days after the airstrike in 2020, the Iraqi parliament passed a resolution requiring the government to end the presence of foreign forces in the country.
On Dec. 29, 2021, then Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi confirmed the end of the U.S.-led coalition's combat mission in Iraq after the withdrawal of their forces from the country.

UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- Five countries -- Ecuador, Japan, Malta, Mozambique and Switzerland -- on Tuesday began to assume responsibilities as non-permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.
Their two-year term officially started on Jan. 1, but the first business day of the Security Council for 2023 after the New Year holiday break is Tuesday, Jan. 3.
A flag installation ceremony was held to mark the start of their responsibilities. The ceremony was initiated by Kazakhstan in 2018.
Kazakhstan's permanent representative Akan Rakhmetullin, who presided over the ceremony, voiced confidence that the five new council members will bring much depth and focus to the pressing issues of global peace and security.
""As we begin a new year, it is clear that the global situation continues to be marked by numerous challenges and crisis, from ongoing conflicts and humanitarian calamities to the negative impacts of climate change and the pandemic,"" Rakhmetullin said.

""So far, there is no particular cause for concern because the COVID-19 variant that prevails in China was detected in Cyprus months ago and it doesn't seem to pose much of a problem,"" Petros Karayiannis, professor of microbiology and molecular virology at the University of Nicosia Medical School, said.
Karayiannis is a member of the scientific team advising the government on the handling of the pandemic.
""Because it concerns Omicron variants, I believe that perhaps it was somewhat excessive that there was such a fuss,"" Karayiannis told the CyBC state radio.
He said that the Omicron subvariant BF.7, a spin-off of the main BA.5 strain, is thought to be responsible for a small percentage of COVID-19 cases in Cyprus and it has not been found to cause more severe symptoms than the other Omicron variants.
Karayiannis said that in his view the virus mutates to increase its transmissibility and to survive, but in doing so it does not become more pestiferous.
According to Karayiannis, the current situation in Cyprus is not causing a concern to medical authorities as new COVID-19 cases have stabilized at about 2,700 per week in a population of less than one million.

U.S. sanctions deprive Iranians of breathing fresh air under severe pollution: experts,"TEHRAN, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- With the arrival of the cold season, the air pollution in Iran's capital Tehran has reached an alarming level and is hazardous for the health of local residents.
Domestic and foreign experts pointed out that under the years-long U.S. sanctions, the forced use of old vehicles, which should have been scrapped long ago, is the cause of the terrible air quality in Tehran.
STATE OF EMERGENCY
Over the past weeks, Tehran's local authorities decided to shut down school and university classes for some days and switched to online learning.
Abed Maleki, deputy director of Civil Affairs Coordination of Tehran Governorate, announced on Monday the continuation of remote working of sensitive groups of employees, including pregnant women, employees aging above 50, and those who have heart, lung, respiratory and rheumatic diseases as well as ones with diabetes, high blood pressure and cancer problems, according to official IRNA news agency.
Maleki said that based on the approvals of the air pollution emergency working group, universities and all educational levels of Tehran will continue online learning for two more days until Wednesday, while sports activities in open spaces are also canceled.
The even-and-odd plans for motorists are implemented as traffic rationing measures under which private vehicles with registration numbers ending with an odd digit will be allowed on the streets on odd dates and those with an even digit on even dates.
Besides, a daily permit license to enter the restricted traffic zones in Tehran will not be issued by Tehran Municipality until Wednesday, Maleki said, urging the citizens to refrain from unnecessary activities outdoors.
RESULT OF SANCTIONS
Abbas Shahsavandi, the head of the air health and climate change department of Iran's Health Ministry, pointed out that the traffic of old cars and diesel motorcycles is the main reason behind Tehran's air pollution.
There are many clunker vehicles and diesel motorcycles in Tehran, which must be removed from the consumption cycle, Shahsavandi was quoted as saying by Tehran Times.
Also, Abdollah Motevalli, deputy director of Iran's Standards and Quality Inspection Company, said that some 83 percent of air pollution in Tehran and 70 percent in other Iranian big cities are caused by vehicles, according to the report.
On Dec. 20, 2022, a group of UN human rights experts announced that ""it is no surprise that Tehran is one of the world's most polluted cities. U.S. sanctions force people to prolong the use of older vehicles that burn fuel less efficiently, while making it impossible for Iran to obtain equipment and technology to reduce vehicle emissions.""
The sanctions also prevent Iranian scientists from engaging in joint environmental research projects abroad, and prevent Iranians from accessing online databases and courses about environmental issues and sustainability, they pointed out.
NEW SOLUTIONS
On Monday, Mojtaba Shafiee, managing director of the Transport and Traffic Organization of Tehran Municipality, stressed that new ideas are needed to tackle the traffic and air pollution in Tehran.
Elaborating on the effect of the even-and-odd plan from the door of the homes on reducing air pollution, he noted that if the plan is implemented correctly, it will be effective in reducing air pollution.
He also announced the holding of the 19th International Conference on Transportation and Traffic Engineering in Tehran in March, with its focus on public and smart transportation among other topics.
Regarding the development of cycling routes in the capital, he stated that the use of shared bicycles is one of the main models of traffic management around the world that should be considered in Tehran.
In the meantime, Motevalli said that all motor vehicles used by government, public and non-government sectors are required to obtain a technical examination certificate, which can be highly effective in reducing air pollution, optimizing fuel consumption and car safety, and consequently the health of citizens.

Scandal over U.S. congressman-elect lying about resume snowballs,"The U.S. Capitol building is seen in Washington, D.C., the United States, Nov. 4, 2022. (Xinhua/Liu Jie)
It is not rare that U.S. politicians tell lies about their life stories and policy proposals to court support.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- A scandal over U.S. Congressman-elect George Santos lying about his resume has been snowballing, casting a bleak shadow over Washington ahead of the sworn-in of a new and divided Congress.
Santos, elected in the 2022 midterm elections to represent New York's 3rd congressional district, admitted to The New York Post last week that he had lied about his work experience and education on the campaign trail.
""My sins here are embellishing my resume. I'm sorry,"" said Santos, a 34-year-old Republican, alleging that the controversy will not deter him ""from having good legislative success.""
LIES &CONFESSION
Santos billed himself as the ""full embodiment of the American dream"" -- an openly gay son of Brazilian immigrants who becomes a ""seasoned Wall Street financier and investor"" with experience working in the business world.
Santos boasted he had worked for high-profile Wall Street firms Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, but neither company could find any records verifying his claims, according to an investigation by The New York Times.
In February 2021, Santos tweeted he and his family owned more than a dozen properties, while tenants did not pay their rent for nearly a year. However, no evidence has been uncovered verifying such claims of property ownership.
Furthermore, he claimed to have received a degree from Baruch College, a public college in New York City, in 2010, which also turned out to be a lie. Officials at the institution, The New York Times reported, ""could find no record of anyone matching his name and date of birth graduating that year.""
In his confession to The New York Post, Santos acknowledged he had ""never worked directly"" for either Citigroup or Goldman Sachs, arguing that it was a ""poor choice of words"" to say he worked for the companies while revealing that he ""does not own any properties"" and ""didn't graduate from any institution of higher learning.""
Santos also clarified he is ""clearly Catholic"" after describing himself as a nonobservant Jew. As to sexual orientation, he confirmed to The New York Post that he was married to a woman for about five years but insisted that he is now a happily married gay man.

""DO YOU HAVE NO SHAME""
Former U.S. Congresswoman from Hawaii and Fox News contributor Tulsi Gabbard ripped Santos to shreds while interviewing the congressman-elect last week, asking him, ""do you have no shame?""
""If I were one of those in New York's 3rd district right now, now that the election is over, and I'm finding out all of these lies that you've told, not just one little lie or one little embellishment,"" Gabbard told Santos. ""These are blatant lies.""
Santos responded by underlining that he has ""the courage"" to admit and face his mistakes and that ""I want to put this past me, so I can deliver for the American people.""
""I understand. Everybody wants to nitpick at me,"" he complained. ""I'm going to reassure this once and for all -- I'm not a facade. I'm not a persona. I have an extensive career that I worked real hard to achieve.""
The Fox News guest host added, ""It's hard to imagine how they could possibly trust your explanations when you're not really even willing to admit the depth of your deception to them.""
CULTURE OF LYING
It is not rare that U.S. politicians tell lies about their life stories and policy proposals to court support.
U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, re-elected to a third term last year, built his political prominence by portraying his parents as exiles from their native Cuba.
But a review of The Washington Post published in 2011 wrote that the Republican's account ""embellishes the facts"" and that ""the real story of his parents' migration appears to be a more conventional immigrant narrative.""
Herschel Walker campaigned against abortion access in 2022 as the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Georgia. However, his former girlfriends have accused him of encouraging or paying for abortion.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat who ran for the White House several years ago, issued a public apology in 2019 for her past claims of Native American ancestry.
""Permanent Washington has created a culture where it's acceptable to lie to further your own interest. Just try not to get caught,"" Gabbard, who left the Democrat to become an independent last year, commented. ""But even when politicians do get caught, people just shrug their shoulders and move on. No big deal, no consequences.""
""So, no one should be surprised that the American people don't trust these politicians. They've got no faith that those in Washington are actually working for the people when they're so clearly working for themselves,"" she pointed out.
Public trust in the U.S. Congress reached an all-time low, with only 7 percent of Americans expressing ""a great deal"" or ""quite a lot"" of confidence in it, according to a Gallup poll released in the summer of 2022.

MUCH DEEPER ROT
Republicans flipped the House of Representatives in last year's midterm elections while Democrats held onto their majority in the Senate. The divided Congress will be sworn in on Tuesday, with Santos to join the ranks and files of American lawmakers despite bipartisan calls for him not to take office.
According to U.S. legal pundits, the House can only prevent candidates from taking office if they violate the Constitution's age, citizenship and state residency requirements. But Santos may face ethics investigations after he's seated.
Federal prosecutors in New York have opened an investigation into Santos, which is in its early stages and has not yet zeroed in on any one allegation of wrongdoing.
Prosecutors are reportedly examining Santos' finances, including potential irregularities involving financial disclosures and loans he made to his campaign as he was running for representing New York's 3rd congressional district, which covers part of the North Shore of Long Island and northeastern Queens.
Jeff Mayhugh, a former candidate for Virginia's 10th congressional district, authored an article published by Newsweek last week, writing that ""Santos's lies exposed a much deeper rot in our political system.""
""He is a symptom of a much bigger problem than just his own dishonesty,"" Mayhugh continued, calling out ""a broken political system that focuses too much on profit and control and too little on serving the people.""

According to UC, nearly 3,500 companies filed for bankruptcy in the said period, around 300 more than in the same period in 2013, when the previous record was registered.
In December alone, UC said that the number of bankruptcies increased by 17 percent year-on-year.
Among hotels and restaurants, the number of bankruptcies was 29 percent higher in December than in the same month in 2021. The respective increase among retailers was 28 percent, UC said.
Meanwhile, the total number of start-ups across all sectors decreased by 13 percent in December compared with the same month in 2021, UC said.

As Sweden eased the COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions, 2021 saw the lowest number of bankruptcies on record. The year 2022 also started on a high note, but concluded with unpleasant surprises, UC economist Johanna Blome said in the press release.
""Ahead of 2022, optimism was high, not least as a result of the record low number of bankruptcies in the past year and the removal of pandemic restrictions. A bright future was predicted for Sweden's entrepreneurs and small business owners, but unfortunately, the year (2022) instead offered a series of unpleasant surprises that affected both the Swedish and the global economy,"" Blome said.
""Many companies face a tough 2023. Smaller companies can suffer from setbacks in liquidity as a result of increased electricity and purchase costs as well as interests,"" Blome said, adding, ""The risk is great that bankruptcies will continue to increase and the number of start-ups will decrease -- at least during the first part of 2023.""
In the week leading up to the 2022 year-end holidays, the Swedish government said that the country was entering a recession that was expected to last until 2025. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to shrink by 0.7 percent this year. Unemployment is expected to grow to 7.8 percent in 2023 and to 8.2 percent in 2024.

The complaints were logged as schools struggled to recover from pandemic-related closures, and add to the declining test scores and growing mental health challenges that display the fragility in large parts of the country's education system.
NEW YORK, Jan. 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Education Department's Office for Civil Rights logged a record nearly 19,000 discrimination complaints in the last fiscal year from Oct. 1, 2021 to Sept. 30, 2022.
The number is more than double the previous year's and breaks the record of 16,000 filed in fiscal year 2016, reported the New York Times on Sunday. ""The latest indicator of how the social and political strife roiling the country is reverberating in the nation's schools,"" the newspaper said, noting that the surge reversed the decline in complaints filed to the office under the Trump administration.
Officials say the complaints -- most alleging discrimination based on disability, race or sex -- reflect grievances that amassed during the worst public health crisis in a century and the most divisive civil rights climate in decades, according to the report.
""The complaints were logged as schools struggled to recover from pandemic-related closures, and add to the declining test scores and growing mental health challenges that display the fragility in large parts of the country's education system,"" it said.
""It reflects the confidence in the Office for Civil Rights as a place to seek redress ... At the same time, the scope and volume of harm that we're asking our babies to navigate is astronomical,"" the report quoted Catherine Lhamon, assistant secretary for civil rights, as saying.

""In 2022, the Ukrainian economy suffered its largest losses and damage in the entire history of independence,"" said the ministry's press service, quoting Yulia Svyrydenko, the first deputy prime minister and economy minister.
In December 2022, Ukraine's GDP declined 34 percent due to a certain stabilization of the situation with energy supply, after a fall of 37 percent in November, the ministry said.
In the fourth quarter of last year, Ukraine's economy experienced a decline of 35.5 percent compared with the same period in 2021, it said.

U.S. gov't announces measures to crack down on illegal immigration,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government announced Thursday new measures to crack down on illegal immigration.
The measures will ""expand and expedite legal pathways for orderly migration"" and ""result in new consequences for those who fail to use those legal pathways,"" said the White House.
Individuals who ""attempt to enter the United States without permission, do not have a legal basis to remain, and cannot be expelled pursuant to Title 42"" will be increasingly subject to expedited removal to their country of origin and subject to a five-year ban on re-entry, according to the White House release.
Title 42 is a U.S. public health authority that also allows border officials to swiftly expel migrants and asylum-seekers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Before asking Congress for funding on Thursday, U.S. President Joe Biden said from the White House that the country's immigration system is ""broken."" He will travel to El Paso, Texas, to assess border enforcement operations on Sunday.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott and at least two other Republican governors sent thousands of migrants from their states to cities led by Democrats last year to protest against the Biden administration's immigration policies and what they called federal inaction to secure America's southern border.

U.S. Congressman Kevin McCarthy from California, the House Republican leader, fell short of the necessary votes to take the gavel in two more rounds of voting Thursday afternoon.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of Representatives hasn't elected a new speaker as the election entered the third day on Thursday.
U.S. Congressman Kevin McCarthy from California, the House Republican leader, fell short of the necessary votes to take the gavel in two more rounds of voting Thursday afternoon.
The 435-seat lower chamber -- where Republicans have a slim majority over Democrats -- is unable to conduct any legislative business until a speaker is elected.
The 118th Congress convened on Tuesday with newly-elected and re-elected senators sworn in while the House has been holding the speaker election for three days.
McCarthy has the support of most House Republicans and former U.S. President Donald Trump but a handful of hardliners have pressured him to decentralize the speaker's power.
It was the first time a House speaker -- who maintains order, manages its proceedings, and governs the administration of its business on the lower chamber's floor -- hadn't been elected on the first ballot in 100 years.
All House Democrats have voted for Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, to be speaker in the election.
Though it's unlikely for Jeffries to attain the position, he is set to become the first African American lawmaker to lead a party in either chamber of the U.S. Congress.
Republicans flipped the House in the 2022 midterm elections and Democrats held onto their majority in the Senate.
U.S. President Joe Biden said Wednesday that it's ""embarrassing for the country"" not to have a fully functional Congress, the legislature of the federal government.

"Indian capital records nearly 4,500 dengue cases, 9 related deaths in 2022","NEW DELHI, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- Indian capital New Delhi recorded 4,469 cases of dengue and nine related deaths in 2022, data released by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) on Thursday showed.
As per data, the highest number of dengue cases in Delhi were logged in October with 1,238 cases and November with 1,420 cases. In the month of December, 874 cases were reported, the data showed.
Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that has rapidly spread in all regions in recent years. The virus is transmitted by female mosquitoes.
Health experts say those who become infected with the virus a second time are at a significantly greater risk of developing severe disease. It causes fever, body aches, nausea, vomiting, internal bleeding, or a fatal drop in blood pressure in severe cases.
In 2021, according to MCD, Delhi reported 9,613 dengue cases and 23 related deaths. Likewise in 2020, the number of dengue cases recorded in Delhi was 1,072, and one related death.
Health experts say cases of vector-borne diseases such as dengue and malaria are usually reported between July and November, sometimes stretching until mid-December.

Interview: China's optimized COVID-19 strategy gives new hope to global economic recovery: Thai expert,"BANGKOK, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- As China is the major growth engine for economic development of the Asia-Pacific and the wider world, its optimized COVID-19 strategy has injected fresh imputes into the global economic recovery, a Thai expert has said.
Noting that the COVID-19 pandemic has been a global disaster for human society, Wirun Phichaiwongphakdee, director of the Thailand-China Research Center of the Belt and Road Initiative, said in a recent interview with Xinhua that the Chinese government has constantly optimized its COVID-19 response measures based on the evolvement of the pandemic and the deepening study on the virus.
China's COVID-19 response measures have been science-based and a testimony to putting the people's interests first -- nothing being more precious than people's lives, he said, adding that China has played an indispensable role in the global fight against the pandemic and recovery of the world economy.
The swift and decisive measures undertaken by the Chinese government to contain the outbreak at the very beginning have won precious time for other countries, he said.
""The time that China has won for others and its experience to contain the outbreak were very precious for the neighboring countries and the wider world to prepare for the pandemic.""
He said China's constant adjustment and optimization of pandemic response measures are based on the increasing scientific understanding of the virus and the disease.
Wirun, who has inoculated the COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by China, said he has been impressed by China's solidarity and cooperation with the global community in overcoming the pandemic.
China has provided COVID-19 vaccines to many developing countries, including Thailand, he said, adding that the vaccines arrived at the height of the pandemic in his country and have played a critical role in Thailand's efforts to contain the outbreak.
""As Thailand is an aging society, more people could have lost their lives without these Chinese vaccines and other assistance provided by China.""
The resumption of work and production in China has played a vital role in providing other countries with critical supplies in fighting COVID-19 and their subsequent efforts to achieve economic recovery.
""China is the major growth engine for economic development of the Asia-Pacific and the world, and its manufacturing sectors are known for high quality and high efficiency.""
""Without 'Made in China', the global economic recovery would have been a non-starter,"" he added.
Wirun also pointed out that the cooperation under the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative has enhanced relations between China and countries in its neighborhood, including Thailand. The China-Laos Railway, for example, has boosted regional connectivity, according to him.
As China's optimized COVID-19 strategy takes effect, people-to-people exchanges and the connectivity between China and other parts of the world will be further strengthened, and the world will see a new hope for recovery, he said.
China recently announced that it would downgrade its management of the infectious disease of COVID-19 from Class A to Class B, starting from Jan. 8, 2023, shifting the focus of the response from stemming infection to caring for infected patients and preventing severe cases.

Looking ahead to 2023, solutions remain in sight to these seemingly intractable problems so long as countries jointly deliver real, concrete actions.
BEIJING, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- The year of 2022 saw a world in turmoil: the United States fueled one conflict after another, the Ukraine crisis dragged on, the COVID-19 pandemic lingered on with Omicron emerging as the new strain.
Inflation, food crisis, energy security, a sluggish world economic recovery, a worrisome climate and stalled climate negotiations ... These overlapping challenges have tested humanity beyond measure.
Looking ahead to 2023, solutions remain in sight to these seemingly intractable problems so long as countries jointly deliver real, concrete actions.
THE UKRAINE CRISIS
The crisis in Ukraine escalated on Feb. 24, 2022, when Russia launched a special military operation against Ukraine. Since then, the U.S.-led West has continued to provide military and economic aid to Ukraine, turning the conflict into a protracted one. The United States and its allies have also imposed tough sanctions on Russia on an unprecedented scale, but have failed to crush the Russian economy.

At present, the Russian and Ukrainian forces are basically caught in a stalemate. Due to huge divisions between the two sides, it is difficult to resolve the crisis through negotiations in the short term.
The United States continued to fan the flame by announcing an additional 1.85 billion U.S. dollars in military aid to Ukraine, including the Patriot air defense system. The U.S. Congress also passed recently the omnibus bill for 2023, which includes up to 45 billion dollars in emergency funding for Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russia lately signaled a military buildup by announcing plans to beef up its armed forces to 1.5 million from 1.15 million.
It remains unpredictable whether the crisis will come to an end or escalate further in 2023, the evolvement of which largely hinges on whether the Western countries can withstand the enormous burden on their economies and national defense from continued aid to Ukraine.
THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
Over the past year, Omicron, a mutated new coronavirus variant, has become the dominant strain in the global pandemic. Omicron is more infectious than previously prevalent strains, has multiple subtypes, and has triggered waves of new outbreaks in countries around the world. However, its pathogenicity is significantly lower, and so is the rate of serious illness and mortality due to infection, prompting countries around the world to gradually adjust their epidemic prevention policies.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has recently voiced his hope of declaring COVID-19 no longer a global health emergency sometime in 2023, and a WHO emergency committee will meet in January to discuss the criteria for declaring such an end.
To battle COVID, scientists around the world are making unremitting efforts to develop next-generation vaccines and antiviral drugs. With the progress of the research and development of COVID vaccine and drugs, humankind will be armed with more weapons against viruses and a strong shield against COVID.
BATTERED WORLD ECONOMY
In 2022, the world economy is beset by multiple difficulties, especially inflation, which has hamstrung many countries. The U.S.-led Western countries have previously implemented ultra-loose monetary policy for a long time to cope with the pandemic and stimulate the economy, sowing the seeds for skyrocketing inflation.
Following the escalation of the Ukraine crisis, Western sanctions against Russia further obstructed the international supply chain already disrupted by the pandemic. The hiking energy and food prices further pushed up inflation, and the price rise of commodities in many European and American countries hit a 40-year high.
To curb inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates swiftly and aggressively, causing other economies' currencies to depreciate sharply and fueling their imported inflation. Many countries have been forced to follow the United States in raising interest rates, triggering fears of recession.
In its World Economic Outlook report released in October 2022, the International Monetary Fund projects global economic growth at 2.7 percent in 2023, down 0.2 percentage points from its July forecast, with the global economy facing significant downside risks.
However, with the release of pent-up demand and the combination of policy effects, China's economy will show clear momentum for recovery and growth, which will add sustained impetus and bring opportunities and confidence to the world economy.
POLITICALLY DIVIDED U.S.
In 2022, the U.S. Democratic and Republican parties continued their bickering, with deep rifts on a range of issues, including abortion rights, gun control and immigration. In the midterm elections held in November 2022, Republicans seized control of the House of Representatives, while Democrats narrowly retained control of the Senate.

With both parties eyeing the 2024 presidential election and the new Congress ""divided"" between the House and the Senate, the Republican Party is expected to pose more challenges to the Joe Biden administration in 2023, leaving its current domestic and foreign policies in a welter of great uncertainty.
The strife within the Republican Party is also likely to intensify. Moderates in the Republican Party may consider dropping their support for Donald Trump, who is planning to run for president in the next election but did poorly in the midterms. Meanwhile, Republicans' narrow majority in the House of Representatives may give the party's extremist wing more opportunity to sway its position in Congress.
Amid political polarization and intensified infighting, U.S. politics remain shrouded by uncertainties, which will affect the U.S. foreign policy and bring about more complexities to the world.
THE ASIA-PACIFIC
In 2022, under U.S. interference, many countries in the Asia-Pacific faced varying degrees of shocks and mounting regional tensions.
One year after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, Afghanistan is still mired in a grave security and humanitarian crisis. On the Korean Peninsula, tensions escalated after the United States and South Korea repeatedly held large-scale joint military drills, prompting the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to counter with missile launches. With the support of the United States, Japan has recently officially adopted three key defense documents including a new version of the National Security Strategy, which proposes to build a so-called ""counterstrike capability,"" a de facto pre-emptive attack capability, and will significantly increase military spending in the next five years, arousing concern in the international community.
Foreseeably, the United States will continue to form cliques and foment trouble in the Asia-Pacific region. Peace will remain a luxury in the region in 2023.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Climate change is a major challenge facing humanity. In 2022, the mega-floods in Pakistan killed more than 1,000 people. The summer heat and drought in Europe dried up the headwaters of the Thames and nearly shut down the Rhine. The recent winter storms that nearly swept across the United States have killed dozens of people. These appalling extreme weather events serve as a grim reminder that it brooks no delay to tackle climate change.

In November 2022, the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP27) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Developed countries remained passive in providing financial and technical support to developing countries, and had yet to deliver their pledged funding of 100 billion dollars a year. As a highlight of the meeting, the conference finally agreed to establish a ""loss and damage"" fund to provide financial assistance to the most vulnerable and hardest hit by climate change, but this is only a first step. Still subject to negotiations in 2023 are key issues such as the form of the fund, funding countries, allocation methods and assistance targets.
Currently, developed economies don't fare well. Confronted with strained energy supply, some developed countries have switched back to coal for power generation and become increasingly unwilling to cut their own emissions and support developing countries in doing so. Under such circumstances, all eyes are on whether the COP28, scheduled for 2023 in Dubai, UAE, will make a difference on the above key issues.

China a key buyer of Cambodia's agricultural products,"PHNOM PENH, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- China is one of the key importers of Cambodia's agricultural produce in 2022, according to a report released by the Cambodian Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries on Thursday.
The report said China had purchased a number of Cambodian agricultural products, particularly milled rice, yellow bananas, mangoes, cassava, cashew nuts, corns, longans and pepper, among others.
It added that 689,702 tons of Cambodian agricultural products had been shipped to China during the January-November period in 2022.
Cambodian Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Dith Tina said China still has much potential to absorb more Cambodian agricultural products, saying that neither country has yet used the maximum potential in this sector.
""Cambodia and China have solid agricultural cooperation, and we have exported rice, mangoes, bananas, and, most recently, longans to China,"" he told Xinhua in a recent interview.
""I would like to encourage all stakeholders of the two countries to promote closer and closer cooperation to find new, better, and more effective ways to respond to the potential we have,"" he added.
Tina said the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement and the Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA), which took effect in January last year, have injected a new impetus into the development of Cambodia's agriculture.
""The RCEP and the CCFTA are all free trade agreements that mutually open the market in all participating countries, thus giving farmers choices to export their agricultural products to various countries,"" he said. ""Both FTAs will contribute not only to the agriculture sector's growth, but also to the farmers' welfare and prosperity.""
Agriculture is one of the four pillars supporting Cambodia's economy. The sector contributed 24.4 percent to the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2021.

House members voted on Wednesday night to adjourn until noon Thursday, prolonging a historical political stalemate that has paralyzed the lower chamber.

House members voted three times on Tuesday -- the opening day of the divided 118th Congress -- but McCarthy fell short of the necessary votes to be the next speaker.
It was the first time a House speaker -- who maintains order, manages its proceedings, and governs the administration of its business on the lower chamber's floor -- hadn't been elected on the first ballot in 100 years.
The 435-seat House will have to vote on until a speaker is elected with a majority of votes. Before that, members cannot be sworn in and committees cannot be formed with the rest of business stalled.
U.S. Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin, a Michigan Democrat, tweeted that the infighting ""isn't just a shame for Republicans, it's bad for the entire country.""
U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, reacted to the political drama surrounding the House speakership vote on Wednesday morning, saying that ""it's embarrassing the way it's taking so long.""
""How do you think this looks to the rest of the world?"" Biden told reporters at the White House before leaving for Hebron, Kentucky. ""It's not a good look. It's not a good thing.""
McCarthy has the support of most House Republicans and former U.S. President Donald Trump, but a handful of hardliners have opposed his bid to lead the conference by arguing that he is insufficiently conservative while refusing to decentralize the speaker's power.
The House has elected a speaker 127 times since 1789. There have been 14 instances of speaker elections requiring multiple ballots.
Thirteen of 14 multiple-ballot elections occurred before the Civil War, when party divisions were more nebulous, according to Congressional historians. The last time a speaker election required two or more votes on the floor happened in 1923.
Harvard legal scholar Laurence Tribe tweeted on Wednesday that ""because the House of Representatives, unlike the Senate, is not a continuing body, it must reassemble itself without full constitutional authority every two years, like someone rebuilding a ship on the open seas.""
""But when the voyage is this rough, that's a sign of dysfunction,"" Tribe said.
All House Democrats have voted for Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, to be speaker.
Though it's unlikely for Jeffries to attain the position, he is set to become the first African American lawmaker to lead a party in either chamber of the U.S. Congress.
Republicans flipped the House in the 2022 midterm elections while Democrats held onto their majority in the Senate.
The new Congress convened for the first time on Tuesday, with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris presiding over the opening of the 100-people upper chamber in which Democrats control 51 seats versus 49 for Republicans.
Chuck Schumer from New York and Mitch McConnell from Kentucky remain the Senate majority leader and minority leader, respectively.

The divided Congress convened for the first time on Tuesday, with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris presiding over the opening of the 100-people upper chamber in which Democrats control 51 seats versus 49 for Republicans.
Chuck Schumer from New York and Mitch McConnell from Kentucky remain the Senate majority leader and minority leader, respectively.

New Zealand's tourism to be greatly boosted with influx of Chinese tourists,"WELLINGTON, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- The orderly resumption of outbound travel for Chinese tourists will be ""a major boon to New Zealand's tourism industry,"" said Lisa Li, a travel operator specialising in the Chinese market.
It is great news that the Chinese market will now rebuild, said Li, managing director of New Zealand's largest travel agency, China Travel Service (NZ) Ltd., who also revealed that there were already more inquiries from Chinese tour groups.
As with Li, New Zealand's Chinese tour guide Uncle Rong has been busy communicating with China's travel agencies and customizing the latest tour itineraries to prepare for Chinese tourists visiting New Zealand this summer.
Nearly 36 million Chinese people are looking to New Zealand as a preferred vacation destination, showed a survey conducted by Tourism New Zealand at the end of 2019.
""The New Zealand tourism industry is very excited about the upcoming arrival of Chinese tourists,"" Rong said.
Grant Bradley, a senior reporter of NZ Herald, deems the re-opening of China crucial for New Zealand's tourism, saying the decision made by China could send a wave of Chinese tourists to destinations like New Zealand.
Spending by international tourists increased 30.6 percent in the year ending March 2022, and New Zealand is looking forward to seeing another jump in the year ending March 2023, said Tourism Minister Stuart Nash on Monday.
""Our regions have already seen a boost in tourism spending and this looks set to continue in the summer months,"" said the minister.
The return of international tourists benefits employment and promotes the economy, Nash said, citing figures that tourism directly employed 145,032 people in the year to March 2022, up by 3,615 year on year.
Chinese tourists not only travel to New Zealand during peak summer months, but also make a significant contribution to New Zealand's tourism in low seasons, helping maintain New Zealand's tourism workforce and improve the industry's overall hospitality capacity, Li said.
The sound bilateral ties and New Zealand's good image in the international tourism market have made Chinese tourists consider the country as a tourist destination, she added.
About 1,000 Chinese tourists arrived in New Zealand in the week early last month, a significant increase from three months earlier, according to the country's statistics agency Stats NZ.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, China was already New Zealand's second biggest tourism market after Australia, and spending by Chinese visitors hit 1.7 billion New Zealand dollars (1.07 billion U.S. dollars) in 2019, showed data from Stats NZ.
