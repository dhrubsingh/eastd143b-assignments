Iraqi protesters blast U.S. for violating sovereignty on 3rd anniversary of deadly drone strike,"BAGHDAD, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraqis on Tuesday rallied to mark the third anniversary of the assassination of two Iraqi and Iranian commanders in a U.S. drone attack, condemning the U.S. terror act and its violation of Iraqi sovereignty.
On the al-Tahrir Square in the capital Baghdad, scores of Iraqis held high the pictures of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy chief of Iraq's paramilitary Hashd Shaabi forces, and Qassem Soleimani, former commander of the Quds Force of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC).
Both Soleimani and al-Muhandis, who played important roles in the war against the extremist Islamic State (IS) militants, were assassinated in the U.S. drone attack on a convoy of vehicles near the Baghdad International Airport on Jan. 3, 2020.
The Iraqi protesters denounced the United States for creating chaos or disasters in Iraq, which was invaded by the U.S. forces in 2003, and even all over the world in the name of ""protecting human rights.""
""They (Americans) target a leader inside our country. (Therefore) there is no sovereignty. Not even the airspace belongs to Iraq. They (U.S. aircraft) enter our airspace and strike our leaders,"" Ahmed Kadhim, a fitness trainer, told Xinhua.
He said the airstrike was a flagrant violation of Iraq's sovereignty, stressing that the United States is an ""undemocratic and inhumane country"".
""America is the creator of terrorism, and it is the country of chaos and wants to spread chaos all over the world,"" Kadhim added.
Sadid Abdul-Ghani, a retired government employee, told Xinhua that the illegal airstrike that assassinated Soleimani and al-Muhandis was a flagrant violation of Iraq's sovereignty, Iraqis' human rights and all international laws.
""This is a painful terrorist act ... It violates human rights in this airstrike and in other acts"" that spread terrorism in Iraq and other countries, Abdul-Ghani said.
He said the United States has been bringing about chaos, internal fight, instability and economic crisis to Iraq and other countries. ""By this airstrike, the United States aimed to dominate Iraq and the region and to control the world,"" he added.
Ahmed Salim, a Baghdad resident, condemned the U.S. airstrike that killed Soleimani and al-Muhandis, saying Washington ""wanted to dominate Iraq.""
""It claims that it fights terrorism, but it committed a terrorist crime at dawn on Jan. 3, 2020,"" he said.
Also on Tuesday, the Iraqi Hashd Shaabi held a memorial service at the site of the airstrike on a road near the Baghdad International Airport, which was attended by many Iraqis.
""The enemies were disappointed, as they thought that by making people absent and killing leaders, the will of nations would be broken, but they missed that the martyrs are the makers of the glory of every nation,"" Falih al-Fayyadh, head of the Hashd Shaabi commission, said in a speech.
""The assassination of the two leaders, al-Muhandis and Soleimani, was orchestrated by (former U.S. President Donald) Trump, but it will not be long before we see him in the dustbin of history,"" al-Fayyadh added.
Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' al-Sudani said in a tweet that ""it is necessary to recall the leaders of victory and their heroism in confronting the most violent extremist terrorist group (IS) known to our contemporary history.""
He said the assassination of the two leaders motivated the Iraqi government to work to ""consolidate sovereignty and work for an Iraq that is independent in its policies and capable of protecting its people.""
The U.S. airstrike that killed Soleimani and al-Muhandis sparked tension and reprisal attacks between Iran and the United States on Iraqi soil.
Two days after the airstrike in 2020, the Iraqi parliament passed a resolution requiring the government to end the presence of foreign forces in the country.
On Dec. 29, 2021, then Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi confirmed the end of the U.S.-led coalition's combat mission in Iraq after the withdrawal of their forces from the country.

"Divided U.S. Congress convenes in scandal, with McCarthy failing initial vote to be elected House speaker","

-- U.S. Congressman Kevin McCarthy lost an initial vote for House speaker on Tuesday afternoon after 19 Republicans voted for others, sending the election to a second ballot.
-- Public trust in the U.S. Congress reached an all-time low, with only 7 percent of Americans expressing ""a great deal"" or ""quite a lot"" of confidence in it, according to a Gallup poll released in the summer of 2022.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- A divided and new U.S. Congress convened Tuesday noon amid a bitter House leadership battle and the snowballing scandal of a congressman-elect lying about his biography.
The session came nearly two months after the 2022 midterm elections, in which Republicans flipped the U.S. House of Representatives and Democrats held onto their majority in the Senate.
U.S. Congressman Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, lost an initial vote for House speaker on Tuesday afternoon after 19 Republicans voted for others, sending the election to a second ballot.
All House Democrats voted for Congressman Hakeem Jeffries from New York to lead the Democratic minority, set to make him the first African American lawmaker to lead a party in either chamber of the U.S. Congress.
If no candidate wins a majority of votes in the next round, House members will vote on and on until a speaker is elected.
U.S. Congressman-elect George Santos, a 34-year-old Republican from New York, is among those who are waiting to be sworn in after the speaker vote.
Santos has recently admitted to lying about his educational history and professional biography but rejected bipartisan calls for him not to take office.
""My sins here are embellishing my resume. I'm sorry,"" embattled Santos acknowledged last week while alleging that the controversy would not deter him ""from having good legislative success.""
Former U.S. Congresswoman and Fox News contributor Tulsi Gabbard commented, ""Washington has created a culture where it's acceptable to lie to further your own interest.""
""But even when politicians do get caught, people just shrug their shoulders and move on,"" Gabbard continued. ""So, no one should be surprised that the American people don't trust these politicians.""
Public trust in the U.S. Congress reached an all-time low, with only 7 percent of Americans expressing ""a great deal"" or ""quite a lot"" of confidence in it, according to a Gallup poll released in the summer of 2022.
Americans' approval of Congress, a separate survey that Gallup conducted following last year's midterm elections suggested, remains largely negative, with 73 percent of U.S. adults expressing disapproval.

U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris presided over the opening day of the Senate with Democrats having a slim 51-49 majority over Republicans, and she swore in 35 either newly elected or reelected senators Tuesday afternoon.
Chuck Schumer from New York and Mitch McConnell from Kentucky, both Senate veterans, will continue to serve as the chamber's majority leader and minority leader, respectively.
The divided Congress with Republicans controlling the House is likely to stall U.S. President Joe Biden's legislative agenda in the next two years.
In addition, top House Republicans have vowed to launch a series of investigations into the Democratic administration, poised to augment partisan discord on Capitol Hill.
""Our politics has gotten so angry, so mean, so partisan,"" Biden said late last year. ""And too often we see each other as enemies, not as neighbors; as Democrats or Republicans, not as fellow Americans. We've become too divided.""
Divided government has been the reality for all U.S. presidents since Ronald Reagan for at least part of their term.

UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- Five countries -- Ecuador, Japan, Malta, Mozambique and Switzerland -- on Tuesday began to assume responsibilities as non-permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.
Their two-year term officially started on Jan. 1, but the first business day of the Security Council for 2023 after the New Year holiday break is Tuesday, Jan. 3.
A flag installation ceremony was held to mark the start of their responsibilities. The ceremony was initiated by Kazakhstan in 2018.
Kazakhstan's permanent representative Akan Rakhmetullin, who presided over the ceremony, voiced confidence that the five new council members will bring much depth and focus to the pressing issues of global peace and security.
""As we begin a new year, it is clear that the global situation continues to be marked by numerous challenges and crisis, from ongoing conflicts and humanitarian calamities to the negative impacts of climate change and the pandemic,"" Rakhmetullin said.

Addressing these acute issues requires cooperation and solidarity as well as the commitment of all UN member states, he said.
The permanent representatives of the five new council members made short speeches before they installed their respective national flags outside the Security Council Chamber.
The five countries replaced India, Ireland, Kenya, Mexico and Norway.
The 15-member Security Council has five permanent members -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, and 10 non-permanent members elected for two-year terms by the UN General Assembly. Five non-permanent members are replaced every year.
Albania, Brazil, Gabon, Ghana and the United Arab Emirates are in the middle of their two-year term as non-permanent members.

"Fuss over China's coronavirus situation unwarranted, says Cyprus virologist","NICOSIA, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- Worry and panic over reports about a surge of coronavirus cases in China are excessive and unwarranted, a leading Cypriot virologist said here on Tuesday.
""So far, there is no particular cause for concern because the COVID-19 variant that prevails in China was detected in Cyprus months ago and it doesn't seem to pose much of a problem,"" Petros Karayiannis, professor of microbiology and molecular virology at the University of Nicosia Medical School, said.
Karayiannis is a member of the scientific team advising the government on the handling of the pandemic.
""Because it concerns Omicron variants, I believe that perhaps it was somewhat excessive that there was such a fuss,"" Karayiannis told the CyBC state radio.
He said that the Omicron subvariant BF.7, a spin-off of the main BA.5 strain, is thought to be responsible for a small percentage of COVID-19 cases in Cyprus and it has not been found to cause more severe symptoms than the other Omicron variants.
Karayiannis said that in his view the virus mutates to increase its transmissibility and to survive, but in doing so it does not become more pestiferous.
According to Karayiannis, the current situation in Cyprus is not causing a concern to medical authorities as new COVID-19 cases have stabilized at about 2,700 per week in a population of less than one million.

Consecutive ballots fail to elect House speaker after divided U.S. Congress convenes,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- Two consecutive ballots on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday afternoon failed to elect a new speaker.
U.S. Congressman Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, lost the second ballot for House speaker after 19 Republicans again voted against him.
A third vote is underway, a scenario that hasn't been seen in a century. A candidate needs 218 votes to become House speaker if no member skips the vote or votes ""present.""
""We stay in until we win,"" McCarthy told reporters, adding that the numbers ""will change eventually.""
The political drama came nearly two months after the 2022 midterm elections, in which Republicans flipped the House and Democrats held onto their majority in the Senate, and shortly after the divided Congress convened Tuesday noon.
All House Democrats have voted for Congressman Hakeem Jeffries from New York to lead the Democratic minority in the first two ballots.
Jemele Hill, a contributing writer for The Atlantic, tweeted on Tuesday afternoon that ""what we're witnessing today in American politics is just another brutal indictment of this dysfunctional political system.""
If no candidate wins a majority of votes in the third round, House members will vote on and on until a speaker is elected.
House members can adjourn to negotiate but the lower chamber does not kick off the new term until the speaker election is over.
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Tuesday afternoon that U.S. President Joe Biden, a former six-term senator, ""will not insert himself in that process.""
""The president served as a U.S. senator for 34 years and he understands how this process works,"" Jean-Pierre said.
U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris presided over the opening day of the Senate, where Democrats have a slim 51-49 majority over Republicans, when she swore in 35 either newly elected or reelected senators Tuesday afternoon.

U.S. sanctions deprive Iranians of breathing fresh air under severe pollution: experts,"TEHRAN, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- With the arrival of the cold season, the air pollution in Iran's capital Tehran has reached an alarming level and is hazardous for the health of local residents.
Domestic and foreign experts pointed out that under the years-long U.S. sanctions, the forced use of old vehicles, which should have been scrapped long ago, is the cause of the terrible air quality in Tehran.
STATE OF EMERGENCY
Over the past weeks, Tehran's local authorities decided to shut down school and university classes for some days and switched to online learning.
Abed Maleki, deputy director of Civil Affairs Coordination of Tehran Governorate, announced on Monday the continuation of remote working of sensitive groups of employees, including pregnant women, employees aging above 50, and those who have heart, lung, respiratory and rheumatic diseases as well as ones with diabetes, high blood pressure and cancer problems, according to official IRNA news agency.
Maleki said that based on the approvals of the air pollution emergency working group, universities and all educational levels of Tehran will continue online learning for two more days until Wednesday, while sports activities in open spaces are also canceled.
The even-and-odd plans for motorists are implemented as traffic rationing measures under which private vehicles with registration numbers ending with an odd digit will be allowed on the streets on odd dates and those with an even digit on even dates.
Besides, a daily permit license to enter the restricted traffic zones in Tehran will not be issued by Tehran Municipality until Wednesday, Maleki said, urging the citizens to refrain from unnecessary activities outdoors.
RESULT OF SANCTIONS
Abbas Shahsavandi, the head of the air health and climate change department of Iran's Health Ministry, pointed out that the traffic of old cars and diesel motorcycles is the main reason behind Tehran's air pollution.
There are many clunker vehicles and diesel motorcycles in Tehran, which must be removed from the consumption cycle, Shahsavandi was quoted as saying by Tehran Times.
Also, Abdollah Motevalli, deputy director of Iran's Standards and Quality Inspection Company, said that some 83 percent of air pollution in Tehran and 70 percent in other Iranian big cities are caused by vehicles, according to the report.
On Dec. 20, 2022, a group of UN human rights experts announced that ""it is no surprise that Tehran is one of the world's most polluted cities. U.S. sanctions force people to prolong the use of older vehicles that burn fuel less efficiently, while making it impossible for Iran to obtain equipment and technology to reduce vehicle emissions.""
The sanctions also prevent Iranian scientists from engaging in joint environmental research projects abroad, and prevent Iranians from accessing online databases and courses about environmental issues and sustainability, they pointed out.
NEW SOLUTIONS
On Monday, Mojtaba Shafiee, managing director of the Transport and Traffic Organization of Tehran Municipality, stressed that new ideas are needed to tackle the traffic and air pollution in Tehran.
Elaborating on the effect of the even-and-odd plan from the door of the homes on reducing air pollution, he noted that if the plan is implemented correctly, it will be effective in reducing air pollution.
He also announced the holding of the 19th International Conference on Transportation and Traffic Engineering in Tehran in March, with its focus on public and smart transportation among other topics.
Regarding the development of cycling routes in the capital, he stated that the use of shared bicycles is one of the main models of traffic management around the world that should be considered in Tehran.
In the meantime, Motevalli said that all motor vehicles used by government, public and non-government sectors are required to obtain a technical examination certificate, which can be highly effective in reducing air pollution, optimizing fuel consumption and car safety, and consequently the health of citizens.

Scandal over U.S. congressman-elect lying about resume snowballs,"

It is not rare that U.S. politicians tell lies about their life stories and policy proposals to court support.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- A scandal over U.S. Congressman-elect George Santos lying about his resume has been snowballing, casting a bleak shadow over Washington ahead of the sworn-in of a new and divided Congress.
Santos, elected in the 2022 midterm elections to represent New York's 3rd congressional district, admitted to The New York Post last week that he had lied about his work experience and education on the campaign trail.
""My sins here are embellishing my resume. I'm sorry,"" said Santos, a 34-year-old Republican, alleging that the controversy will not deter him ""from having good legislative success.""
LIES &CONFESSION
Santos billed himself as the ""full embodiment of the American dream"" -- an openly gay son of Brazilian immigrants who becomes a ""seasoned Wall Street financier and investor"" with experience working in the business world.
Santos boasted he had worked for high-profile Wall Street firms Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, but neither company could find any records verifying his claims, according to an investigation by The New York Times.
In February 2021, Santos tweeted he and his family owned more than a dozen properties, while tenants did not pay their rent for nearly a year. However, no evidence has been uncovered verifying such claims of property ownership.
Furthermore, he claimed to have received a degree from Baruch College, a public college in New York City, in 2010, which also turned out to be a lie. Officials at the institution, The New York Times reported, ""could find no record of anyone matching his name and date of birth graduating that year.""
In his confession to The New York Post, Santos acknowledged he had ""never worked directly"" for either Citigroup or Goldman Sachs, arguing that it was a ""poor choice of words"" to say he worked for the companies while revealing that he ""does not own any properties"" and ""didn't graduate from any institution of higher learning.""
Santos also clarified he is ""clearly Catholic"" after describing himself as a nonobservant Jew. As to sexual orientation, he confirmed to The New York Post that he was married to a woman for about five years but insisted that he is now a happily married gay man.

""DO YOU HAVE NO SHAME""
Former U.S. Congresswoman from Hawaii and Fox News contributor Tulsi Gabbard ripped Santos to shreds while interviewing the congressman-elect last week, asking him, ""do you have no shame?""
""If I were one of those in New York's 3rd district right now, now that the election is over, and I'm finding out all of these lies that you've told, not just one little lie or one little embellishment,"" Gabbard told Santos. ""These are blatant lies.""
Santos responded by underlining that he has ""the courage"" to admit and face his mistakes and that ""I want to put this past me, so I can deliver for the American people.""
""I understand. Everybody wants to nitpick at me,"" he complained. ""I'm going to reassure this once and for all -- I'm not a facade. I'm not a persona. I have an extensive career that I worked real hard to achieve.""
The Fox News guest host added, ""It's hard to imagine how they could possibly trust your explanations when you're not really even willing to admit the depth of your deception to them.""
CULTURE OF LYING
It is not rare that U.S. politicians tell lies about their life stories and policy proposals to court support.
U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, re-elected to a third term last year, built his political prominence by portraying his parents as exiles from their native Cuba.
But a review of The Washington Post published in 2011 wrote that the Republican's account ""embellishes the facts"" and that ""the real story of his parents' migration appears to be a more conventional immigrant narrative.""
Herschel Walker campaigned against abortion access in 2022 as the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Georgia. However, his former girlfriends have accused him of encouraging or paying for abortion.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat who ran for the White House several years ago, issued a public apology in 2019 for her past claims of Native American ancestry.
""Permanent Washington has created a culture where it's acceptable to lie to further your own interest. Just try not to get caught,"" Gabbard, who left the Democrat to become an independent last year, commented. ""But even when politicians do get caught, people just shrug their shoulders and move on. No big deal, no consequences.""
""So, no one should be surprised that the American people don't trust these politicians. They've got no faith that those in Washington are actually working for the people when they're so clearly working for themselves,"" she pointed out.
Public trust in the U.S. Congress reached an all-time low, with only 7 percent of Americans expressing ""a great deal"" or ""quite a lot"" of confidence in it, according to a Gallup poll released in the summer of 2022.

MUCH DEEPER ROT
Republicans flipped the House of Representatives in last year's midterm elections while Democrats held onto their majority in the Senate. The divided Congress will be sworn in on Tuesday, with Santos to join the ranks and files of American lawmakers despite bipartisan calls for him not to take office.
According to U.S. legal pundits, the House can only prevent candidates from taking office if they violate the Constitution's age, citizenship and state residency requirements. But Santos may face ethics investigations after he's seated.
Federal prosecutors in New York have opened an investigation into Santos, which is in its early stages and has not yet zeroed in on any one allegation of wrongdoing.
Prosecutors are reportedly examining Santos' finances, including potential irregularities involving financial disclosures and loans he made to his campaign as he was running for representing New York's 3rd congressional district, which covers part of the North Shore of Long Island and northeastern Queens.
Jeff Mayhugh, a former candidate for Virginia's 10th congressional district, authored an article published by Newsweek last week, writing that ""Santos's lies exposed a much deeper rot in our political system.""
""He is a symptom of a much bigger problem than just his own dishonesty,"" Mayhugh continued, calling out ""a broken political system that focuses too much on profit and control and too little on serving the people.""

Sweden sees highest number of bankruptcy filings since 2013,"

STOCKHOLM, Jan. 2 (Xinhua) -- Due mainly to the ongoing Ukraine crisis, the accelerating rate of inflation and high electricity prices, the number of bankruptcies in Sweden rose to the highest level in a decade during the second half of 2022, according to statistics released on Monday.
Between July and December 2022, 22 percent more bankruptcies were registered than in the same period in 2021, business and credit reference agency UC said in a press release.
According to UC, nearly 3,500 companies filed for bankruptcy in the said period, around 300 more than in the same period in 2013, when the previous record was registered.
In December alone, UC said that the number of bankruptcies increased by 17 percent year-on-year.
Among hotels and restaurants, the number of bankruptcies was 29 percent higher in December than in the same month in 2021. The respective increase among retailers was 28 percent, UC said.
Meanwhile, the total number of start-ups across all sectors decreased by 13 percent in December compared with the same month in 2021, UC said.

As Sweden eased the COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions, 2021 saw the lowest number of bankruptcies on record. The year 2022 also started on a high note, but concluded with unpleasant surprises, UC economist Johanna Blome said in the press release.
""Ahead of 2022, optimism was high, not least as a result of the record low number of bankruptcies in the past year and the removal of pandemic restrictions. A bright future was predicted for Sweden's entrepreneurs and small business owners, but unfortunately, the year (2022) instead offered a series of unpleasant surprises that affected both the Swedish and the global economy,"" Blome said.
""Many companies face a tough 2023. Smaller companies can suffer from setbacks in liquidity as a result of increased electricity and purchase costs as well as interests,"" Blome said, adding, ""The risk is great that bankruptcies will continue to increase and the number of start-ups will decrease -- at least during the first part of 2023.""
In the week leading up to the 2022 year-end holidays, the Swedish government said that the country was entering a recession that was expected to last until 2025. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to shrink by 0.7 percent this year. Unemployment is expected to grow to 7.8 percent in 2023 and to 8.2 percent in 2024.

The complaints were logged as schools struggled to recover from pandemic-related closures, and add to the declining test scores and growing mental health challenges that display the fragility in large parts of the country's education system.
NEW YORK, Jan. 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Education Department's Office for Civil Rights logged a record nearly 19,000 discrimination complaints in the last fiscal year from Oct. 1, 2021 to Sept. 30, 2022.
The number is more than double the previous year's and breaks the record of 16,000 filed in fiscal year 2016, reported the New York Times on Sunday. ""The latest indicator of how the social and political strife roiling the country is reverberating in the nation's schools,"" the newspaper said, noting that the surge reversed the decline in complaints filed to the office under the Trump administration.
Officials say the complaints -- most alleging discrimination based on disability, race or sex -- reflect grievances that amassed during the worst public health crisis in a century and the most divisive civil rights climate in decades, according to the report.
""The complaints were logged as schools struggled to recover from pandemic-related closures, and add to the declining test scores and growing mental health challenges that display the fragility in large parts of the country's education system,"" it said.
""It reflects the confidence in the Office for Civil Rights as a place to seek redress ... At the same time, the scope and volume of harm that we're asking our babies to navigate is astronomical,"" the report quoted Catherine Lhamon, assistant secretary for civil rights, as saying.

STOCKHOLM, Jan. 1 (Xinhua) -- Sweden on Sunday took over from the Czech Republic at the helm of the six-month rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU).
Sweden will hold the presidency for six months until June 30, 2023.

Kristersson told his country's Parliament that ""Sweden is taking over the Presidency at a time when the European Union is facing unprecedented challenges. A greener, more secure and freer Europe is the foundation of our priorities.""
In the field of security (or unity), the Swedish presidency will prioritize ""continued economic and military support for Ukraine, as well as support for Ukraine's path towards the EU,"" according to the government's website.
""The fight against cross-border organized crime will continue, responding to citizens' legitimate demands for safe and secure communities,"" it said.

In the field of resilience (or competitiveness), ""the EU must continue to provide the best possible conditions for a sound and open economy based on free competition, private investment and successful digitization,"" it said, adding that the Swedish presidency would seek to anchor a concerted approach to European competitiveness ""at the top of the political agenda.""
In the field of prosperity (or green and energy transition), it said that the Swedish presidency would continue efforts to tackle high and volatile energy prices while addressing long-term energy market reform.
The government also stressed the need to provide the right regulatory framework and policies to attract investments required for the transition to ""a resource-efficient, fossil-free future.""
And in the field of democratic values and the rule of law, the Swedish presidency emphasized the importance to uphold ""the principle of the rule of law and fundamental rights.""
Kristersson is scheduled to meet with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in the northern Swedish city of Kiruna on Jan. 13, when they would hold talks on relevant work plans during the Swedish presidency and issues that need to be resolved in the near future.
Sweden joined the EU on Jan. 1, 1995, and the country held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union twice before, respectively in 2001 and 2009.

In this regard, fighting against inequality and for equal access to healthcare, education and culture has been my priority since I entered politics,"" Berset told local media recently.
He said that Switzerland has a fundamental interest in a stable and well-structured relationship with the European Union, and keeping neutrality is the only option for Switzerland.

PARIS, Jan. 2 (Xinhua) -- The systematic pre-departure or on-arrival testing of travelers from China for COVID-19 is ""neither scientifically justified nor risk-based,"" the Europe branch of Airports Council International (ACI EUROPE) said recently.

""These unilateral actions are at odds with all the experience and evidence gained over the past three years,"" it said, adding that ""these travel restrictions do not work.""

China a key buyer of Cambodia's agricultural products,"PHNOM PENH, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- China is one of the key importers of Cambodia's agricultural produce in 2022, according to a report released by the Cambodian Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries on Thursday.
The report said China had purchased a number of Cambodian agricultural products, particularly milled rice, yellow bananas, mangoes, cassava, cashew nuts, corns, longans and pepper, among others.
It added that 689,702 tons of Cambodian agricultural products had been shipped to China during the January-November period in 2022.
Cambodian Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Dith Tina said China still has much potential to absorb more Cambodian agricultural products, saying that neither country has yet used the maximum potential in this sector.
""Cambodia and China have solid agricultural cooperation, and we have exported rice, mangoes, bananas, and, most recently, longans to China,"" he told Xinhua in a recent interview.
""I would like to encourage all stakeholders of the two countries to promote closer and closer cooperation to find new, better, and more effective ways to respond to the potential we have,"" he added.
Tina said the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement and the Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA), which took effect in January last year, have injected a new impetus into the development of Cambodia's agriculture.
""The RCEP and the CCFTA are all free trade agreements that mutually open the market in all participating countries, thus giving farmers choices to export their agricultural products to various countries,"" he said. ""Both FTAs will contribute not only to the agriculture sector's growth, but also to the farmers' welfare and prosperity.""
Agriculture is one of the four pillars supporting Cambodia's economy. The sector contributed 24.4 percent to the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2021.

U.S. House still in turmoil with no speaker elected on 2nd day of voting,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of Representatives remains in turmoil with no speaker elected on the second day of voting.
House members voted on Wednesday night to adjourn until noon Thursday, prolonging a historical political stalemate that has paralyzed the lower chamber.
U.S. Congressman Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, failed to secure enough votes another three times earlier in the day due to intra-party division.
House members voted three times on Tuesday -- the opening day of the divided 118th Congress -- but McCarthy fell short of the necessary votes to be the next speaker.
It was the first time a House speaker -- who maintains order, manages its proceedings, and governs the administration of its business on the lower chamber's floor -- hadn't been elected on the first ballot in 100 years.
The 435-seat House will have to vote on until a speaker is elected with a majority of votes. Before that, members cannot be sworn in and committees cannot be formed with the rest of business stalled.
U.S. Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin, a Michigan Democrat, tweeted that the infighting ""isn't just a shame for Republicans, it's bad for the entire country.""
U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, reacted to the political drama surrounding the House speakership vote on Wednesday morning, saying that ""it's embarrassing the way it's taking so long.""
""How do you think this looks to the rest of the world?"" Biden told reporters at the White House before leaving for Hebron, Kentucky. ""It's not a good look. It's not a good thing.""
McCarthy has the support of most House Republicans and former U.S. President Donald Trump, but a handful of hardliners have opposed his bid to lead the conference by arguing that he is insufficiently conservative while refusing to decentralize the speaker's power.
The House has elected a speaker 127 times since 1789. There have been 14 instances of speaker elections requiring multiple ballots.
Thirteen of 14 multiple-ballot elections occurred before the Civil War, when party divisions were more nebulous, according to Congressional historians. The last time a speaker election required two or more votes on the floor happened in 1923.
Harvard legal scholar Laurence Tribe tweeted on Wednesday that ""because the House of Representatives, unlike the Senate, is not a continuing body, it must reassemble itself without full constitutional authority every two years, like someone rebuilding a ship on the open seas.""
""But when the voyage is this rough, that's a sign of dysfunction,"" Tribe said.
All House Democrats have voted for Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, to be speaker.
Though it's unlikely for Jeffries to attain the position, he is set to become the first African American lawmaker to lead a party in either chamber of the U.S. Congress.
Republicans flipped the House in the 2022 midterm elections while Democrats held onto their majority in the Senate.
The new Congress convened for the first time on Tuesday, with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris presiding over the opening of the 100-people upper chamber in which Democrats control 51 seats versus 49 for Republicans.
Chuck Schumer from New York and Mitch McConnell from Kentucky remain the Senate majority leader and minority leader, respectively.

McCarthy has the support of most House Republicans and former U.S. President Donald Trump but a handful of hardliners have opposed his bid to lead the conference by arguing that he is insufficiently conservative while refusing to decentralize the speaker's power.
Trump reaffirmed his support for McCarthy on Wednesday morning, urging Republican House members to elect him and not to ""turn a great triumph into a giant &embarrassing defeat"" in a social media post.
U.S. Congressman Matt Gaetz, a longtime Trump supporter and one of the House Republicans seeking to doom McCarthy's quest to take the gavel, responded in a statement that the former Republican president's suggestion ""changes neither my view of McCarthy nor Trump nor my vote.""
McCarthy told reporters that ""I think we'll get to 218,"" as he appeared on Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning despite no clear path yet to break the historic deadlock.

New Zealand's tourism to be greatly boosted with influx of Chinese tourists,"WELLINGTON, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- The orderly resumption of outbound travel for Chinese tourists will be ""a major boon to New Zealand's tourism industry,"" said Lisa Li, a travel operator specialising in the Chinese market.
It is great news that the Chinese market will now rebuild, said Li, managing director of New Zealand's largest travel agency, China Travel Service (NZ) Ltd., who also revealed that there were already more inquiries from Chinese tour groups.
As with Li, New Zealand's Chinese tour guide Uncle Rong has been busy communicating with China's travel agencies and customizing the latest tour itineraries to prepare for Chinese tourists visiting New Zealand this summer.
Nearly 36 million Chinese people are looking to New Zealand as a preferred vacation destination, showed a survey conducted by Tourism New Zealand at the end of 2019.
""The New Zealand tourism industry is very excited about the upcoming arrival of Chinese tourists,"" Rong said.
Grant Bradley, a senior reporter of NZ Herald, deems the re-opening of China crucial for New Zealand's tourism, saying the decision made by China could send a wave of Chinese tourists to destinations like New Zealand.
Spending by international tourists increased 30.6 percent in the year ending March 2022, and New Zealand is looking forward to seeing another jump in the year ending March 2023, said Tourism Minister Stuart Nash on Monday.
""Our regions have already seen a boost in tourism spending and this looks set to continue in the summer months,"" said the minister.
The return of international tourists benefits employment and promotes the economy, Nash said, citing figures that tourism directly employed 145,032 people in the year to March 2022, up by 3,615 year on year.
Chinese tourists not only travel to New Zealand during peak summer months, but also make a significant contribution to New Zealand's tourism in low seasons, helping maintain New Zealand's tourism workforce and improve the industry's overall hospitality capacity, Li said.
The sound bilateral ties and New Zealand's good image in the international tourism market have made Chinese tourists consider the country as a tourist destination, she added.
About 1,000 Chinese tourists arrived in New Zealand in the week early last month, a significant increase from three months earlier, according to the country's statistics agency Stats NZ.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, China was already New Zealand's second biggest tourism market after Australia, and spending by Chinese visitors hit 1.7 billion New Zealand dollars (1.07 billion U.S. dollars) in 2019, showed data from Stats NZ.

US once-in-a-century political chaos disturb the world,"
The US Capitol building is seen in Washington, DC., on November 4, 2022. Photo: Xinhua
Right before the second anniversary of the Capitol riots, on January 3, 2023, another political chaos, dubbed by CNN as a ""horror show,"" happened in the same place. US House of Representatives went through a ""difficult labor"" of a new speaker after three rounds of voting failed. The last time a House speaker vote went to multiple ballots was 100 years ago. Tuesday's occurrence was truly a once-in-a-century phenomenon. During Capitol riots, American rioters shocked the building from the outside. This time, the stalemate was the result of conflicts from inside the Capitol. The two events are chaotic phenomena of spread and aggravation of the disease of US political system.
The one who failed to pass the three rounds of the votes for US House speaker is Kevin McCarthy. In the eyes of outsiders, he is a well-known ultra-conservative politician. He is against Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, and promised to overturn a number of relevant legislations that Washington has passed. His crazy anti-China remarks also left a very bad impression on the Chinese people. However, astonishingly, McCarthy was not opposed because of his radicalism, but because he was considered not tough enough by some more radical congressmen in the Republican Party. It shows how severe the division and polarization in the US politics are.
What happened in the highest hall of ""US democracy"" is not a simple farce, but a political thriller with huge destructiveness, and a wide-ranging and far-reaching impact. This not only worries Americans, but also political observers from quite a few countries internationally.
While the antagonism between political parties in the US continues to escalate, the internal divisions in the Republican and the Democratic parties have become increasingly prominent. At this time, a completely irrational and dangerous tendency has surfaced in Washington: finding or creating an ""enemy"" outside the US to suppress, alleviate and divert political divisions within the country.
As a result, China, which is developing rapidly in economy and has a different political system and ideology from the US, is forcibly being established as an ""enemy of the US."" Some lawmakers are scrambling to show their toughness toward China. The tougher, the better. They will gradually fall into collective self-hypnosis, and will keep a blind eye on the fact that the enemy of ""US democracy"" is actually the US itself.
The US House of Representatives will continue to vote on Wednesday, but to some extent the result is no longer important. McCarthy is intensely negotiating with his opponents in the Republican Party. To put it bluntly, it is a political exchange, and he is likely to make a more ""tough"" promise in the future. If McCarthy is still elected after some tossing and turning, then his extreme words and actions may intensify.
In fact, the current difficult status of China-US relations has a lot to do with US sick party politics. Meanwhile, the electoralization of political party functions, the frequent emergence of extreme issues, and the rise of veto politics has spilled over from the US to many countries and international institutions, causing widespread concerns and seriously hindering international cooperation.
History proves that political parties' ""being at daggers drawn"" in the US Congress often indicates major turmoil.
Before this time, there have been 14 times in the history of the US that Congress was unable to elect a speaker in the first round of voting, 13 of which occurred before the Civil War, and the elections in 1855 and 1859 before the outbreak of the war were among the most voted - 133 and 44 times respectively.
Amid rising political animosity, 90 percent of Americans expect 2023 to be a year of political conflict in the US, according to the latest Gallup poll. More than 70 percent of Americans disapprove of the performance of Congress, according to a previous Gallup poll. This reflects a general disappointment in the US society with its domestic politics, and also shows that the ""anti-democracy"" in the US has developed to an advanced stage, and has caused it to be trapped in the cocoon of ""veto politics,"" losing the momentum of innovation, and will become more radical in the future. Such a US is dangerous to the world.
Faced with the political chaos in the US, Canada's Globe and Mail raised a sharp question: whether the political class of the country is able to govern, and whether the internal conflicts and contradictions of one of the major political parties contaminate the entire system.
Another Canadian media quoted a research report saying that the toxic political culture in Washington and across the US was spilling over the border. ""Canada is picking up the political radicalization bug from the US.""
It seems that as Canada is a close neighbor of the US, its feeling is very distinct. When such a US shamelessly claims the world cannot lose US leadership, isn't that horrific?

"Russian student thanks TCM, people in COVID-19 fight","BEIJING, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- A couple of weeks ago, Russian student Yulia Temelidi caught Omicron in China, but she recovered soon with the help of a small health kit with different types of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).
""Unlike Western medicines, TCM tends to have less side effects, and my body will accept TCM a little bit more calmly,"" said Temelidi, who studies at China's Tsinghua University.
Having lived in China for years, she holds the view that TCM has played an important role in fighting the virus over the past three years. She even recommends TCM to her best friend, who now takes it as a wonder for the successful treatment of many kinds of diseases.
Temelidi has found TCM very useful even before her Omicron infection. ""The TCM health kit could help me a lot when I have a headache or a stomachache or just a small fever. In winter, the medicine called Qingyandiwan helped me a lot with sore throat.""
Temelidi said that during the past three years of fight against virus variants, China had provided good protection to its people as well as foreigners in China.
During the first pop-out of COVID-19, Temelidi was in China staying at home. Very few things about the coronavirus were well understood by scientists at that time, and China made strict prevention and control policies to protect people, she said.
""At that time, the only thing that I could do is to stay at home,"" she said, noting COVID-19 was absolutely really horrible then.
In 2021, Temelidi learned that some of her friends in Russia caught COVID-19, and it seemed like a horrible experience. ""They were having a type of Alpha virus or Delta virus. One of my friends experienced a fever of about 40 degrees Celsius for more than a week. He couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, didn't have any taste in his mouth, and it was absolutely horrible.""
In her eyes, China raced against time during the three years to inoculate its people and conduct research on possible new medicines.
In her three years of study, the international student was impressed with warmth and goodwill from surrounding people. As she had to study online sometimes, the Russian student felt worried at the beginning.
""Actually, I've been kind of anxious and kind of worried that I couldn't get everything that I needed, such as the proper amount of knowledge, and I don't have a clear idea of how to live in China. But people around me, including all the professors, helped me a lot. My professors told me to message them every time I had a question, and they would answer me very soon,"" Temelidi said.
She also spoke highly of the medical staff doing regular nucleic acid tests. ""I want to say a huge thank you to them, because, first of all, it's really hard for them to wake up in morning to the same job every time. This is very hard and very challenging for their body, for their health,"" she said, adding that the medics were braving the biggest risk of actually getting COVID-19 for the sake of others' health.
With China's optimized prevention and control policies, she now plans to spend the coming Spring Festival in south China's resort city of Guilin. ""With evolving COVID-19 response strategy, our life is returning to normal,"" said Temelidi.

Feature: Filipino durian growers eye more income as exports to China cleared,"MANILA, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- Jomar Abdon, 29, took on one of Davao City's durian processing facility's critical tasks: sorting durians. Standing in front of a pile of durians, he sorted out skillfully the high-quality spiky fruits and prepared them for packaging.
Abdon is happy that China cleared the exportation of Philippine durians to China on Wednesday, saying that the move could raise the income of the local growers of the tropical fruit in Davao City, the Philippines' third largest city. Abdon's daily workload is likely to increase as a result.
""Our durians in Davao City are more delicious. For us, it is better to have our produce recognized by (China) and exported (there). It is an added income to farmers. More people will benefit from the proceeds,"" he said.
As one of the most lucrative fruits that command a good price in the world's largest consumer market, access to the enormous Chinese market is a bonanza for Filipino durian growers, especially those in Davao City, whose durian production accounts for about 80 percent of the national total.
The local durian season in Davao City is from July to October every year. Compared to other renowned durian varieties, the popular varieties in Davao City, namely Puyat and D101, are more resistant to pests and more productive.
Candelario Miculob, the former head of Davao City's Durian Planters Association, told Xinhua that Davao City currently produces more than 50,000 tons of durian annually, with over 3,000 growers and more than five processing factories.
According to Miculob, if each household is calculated based on the planting area of 1 hectare with 100 bearing trees, each family will have an additional income of about 2,800 U.S. dollars. After the opening up of the Chinese market, he said China will become the Philippines' largest durian export destination.
""We are encouraging farmers to plant more. It will increase the farmers' income, hopefully, improve their livelihood, and help reduce poverty. The two countries will improve their agricultural cooperation, and the Philippines will benefit from the increased agricultural output through the durian export,"" he added.
According to the Philippine Department of Agriculture, around 9,696 direct jobs and 1,126 indirect jobs will be generated after Philippine durians are cleared to export to China. Direct jobs include additional workforce in farm and packing facilities, while indirect jobs include those in packaging, logistics and other services sectors.
In recent years, the Philippines and China have achieved fruitful agricultural cooperation, bringing tangible benefits to the people of the two countries.
With bananas, pineapples, mangos, young coconuts, and avocados from the Philippines being put on the table of the Chinese people, China has already established itself as one of the top importers of Philippine agricultural products. This position is expected to grow stronger as China seeks to expand its Philippine fruit imports further to boost agricultural cooperation between the two countries.
Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian said the first of the four major areas of cooperation identified by leaders of the two countries, is agricultural cooperation. He said that although the tropical fruits in the Philippines are of high quality, the income level of the large population of fruit farmers is relatively low.
""Therefore, we hope some Philippine fruits that are popular with Chinese consumers can be exported to China, and durian is one of the best choices. We look forward to Philippine durians being placed on the dining table of the Chinese people soon,"" he added.

Interview: Philippine expert expects China's COVID policy adjustment to add new impetus to world economy,"MANILA, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- As its COVID-19 strategy has been adjusted to the changing situation of the pandemic in a planned, science-based approach, China's economy will likely see a ""robust recovery"" and help boost global economic growth in 2023, a Philippine expert has said.
Given the relatively mild Omicron variant, a better-equipped health system and a largely vaccinated population in China, ""I think that new policies on COVID-19 are one way of simulating and preparing for"" a wider opening of the Chinese economy to the world in the near future, Anna Malindog-Uy, vice president of the Manila-based think tank Asian Century Philippines Strategic Studies Institute, told Xinhua in a recent interview.
The optimized anti-COVID measures will not only ""revitalize economic activities and investments in the country,"" but also ""benefit the wider international community,"" she said.
""The outlook for the Chinese economy in 2023 is definitely positive. I believe China's economic development will soar high,"" said the researcher, who reckoned the Chinese economy will be ""on an upward trajectory, helping pull up the downward economic trajectory of the world while boosting the recovery of the world economy.""
As the world's second-largest economy, one of the biggest consumer markets, and a major trading partner of almost all economies, the wider China opens to the world, the more other countries will benefit from it through economic and trade cooperation, she said. ""It is not only a huge market, but it has a substantial middle-class population with a relatively high purchasing capacity compared to other countries in the developing world.""
In addition, a further opening of the Chinese market and economy will ""reinvigorate the global industrial and supply chains, and countries around the globe will also benefit from this,"" Malindog-Uy said.
From the anti-COVID battle to the post-pandemic recovery, China has always stood with other developing countries. ""I'm impressed with China's generosity and solidarity with the rest of the world, especially during the initial onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the expert said, citing cooperation between China and the Philippines to curb the pandemic as an example.
Their cooperation ""has been critical in the Philippines' quest for a quick economic bounce back and recovery from the economic devastation brought by the pandemic,"" she added.
China has contributed to the pandemic response of the Philippines ""unprecedentedly."" The list of China's donations includes billions of pesos worth of medical supplies and equipment, and most notably, millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines, Malindog-Uy said.
""China is the first country to send and donate vaccines to the Philippines that made it possible for the Philippine government to kick off its COVID-19 national vaccination program sooner than later,"" she said.
""Indeed, China is a friend of the Philippines especially in times of need,"" she concluded.

Sunak made five pledges: to halve inflation, grow the economy, reduce national debt, cut hospital waiting lists and stop illegal migrant boats crossing the English Channel.
LONDON, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- United Kingdom (UK) Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged to halve inflation and boost the country's economy in his first major speech in 2023 on Wednesday.
Sunak made five pledges. These are: to halve inflation; to grow the economy; to reduce national debt; to cut hospital waiting lists; and to stop illegal migrant boats crossing the English Channel.
Calling these the ""people's priorities,"" Sunak vowed to ""work night and day"" to deliver for the British people.

He said his government will halve inflation this year to reduce the cost of living and give people financial security. According to official figures, the UK's annual inflation dipped to 10.7 percent in November from 11.1 percent in October.
Last November, the Bank of England (BoE) said it expected the country's consumer price index (CPI) to drop sharply after the middle of 2023.
To grow the economy, Sunak pledged to create better-paid jobs and opportunities across the country. However, this may prove to be an uphill task.
According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the UK's gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.3 percent in the third quarter of 2022. The BoE also warned that the country's economy is bound to remain in recession throughout 2023 and the first half of 2024, and GDP will recover only gradually thereafter.

Reducing public debt has always been a priority for Sunak's fiscal policies since he took office in late October. In his Autumn Statement, Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt announced a package of tax hikes and spending cuts in a bid to improve the public finances and restore the country's economic credibility.
In Sunak's fourth pledge, he promised that the waiting lists of the National Health Service (NHS) will fall and people will get the care they need more quickly. According to the British Medical Association (BMA), in October 2022, a record 7.21 million people were waiting for medical treatment in the UK.
Sunak also vowed to pass new laws to curb the arrival of migrants in ""small boats,"" on the country's coast. ""If you come to this country illegally, you are detained and swiftly removed,"" he said.

The Times newspaper cited official figures as showing that a record 45,756 migrants crossed the English Channel to the UK last year.
In his speech, Sunak also said that he plans to ensure that all pupils in the country study maths until the age of 18.
He said the UK was one of the few countries in the world not to require children to study maths in some form up to that age.
""Improving education,"" he said, ""is the closest thing to a silver bullet there is. It is the best economic policy, the best social policy, the best moral policy.""

Electricity supply affected by 72-hour strike in India's western state,"NEW DELHI, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- Electricity supply in parts of India's western state of Maharashtra was affected on Wednesday as thousands of the employees of three government-owned companies went on a 72-hour strike.
The employees are protesting against the local government's move to privatize the power firms, and demanding it should not issue a parallel distribution licence to a private power subsidiary.
Reports said the strike has hit electricity supply in nine districts of Maharashtra. Authorities have deployed police forces at sensitive places like power plants.
Representative of Maharashtra State Electricity Workers' Federation Krushna Bhoir told the media that the protest was going on peacefully as the protesting employees were sitting in make-shift tents outside their establishments.
Meanwhile, the local government has invoked the Maharashtra Essential Services Maintenance Act (MESMA) and asked the officials concerned to take all necessary steps to ensure normal supply of electricity in the state, according to media reports.
The strike is set to continue until Friday and the employee unions have urged consumers to make backup arrangements.

Feature: Iranian youngsters learn more about China through drawing,"TEHRAN, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- ""My painting is both about modern China and traditional China,"" 13-year-old Mahshid Ghasemi said on Wednesday when introducing her work, which won the first prize in the first China-themed painting competition for Iranian children and teenagers.
The contest, jointly organized by the Chinese Embassy in Iran and Iran's Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults (Kanoon), was divided into two age groups, and received 427 paintings from young people across Iran. Each group was awarded one first prize, two second prizes, and three third prizes.
An award ceremony and the opening ceremony of the drawing exhibition were held on Wednesday. The works showcased at the exhibition feature iconic elements of Chinese culture, such as red lanterns, the Great Wall, and dragons, demonstrating Iranian children's imagination and thinking about China.
Ghasemi, from Isfahan province, said she used a dragon, fans, and ancient buildings to depict the traditional part of China with red as the main color and illustrated scenes of Chinese people celebrating the Lunar New Year.
Meanwhile, in the modern China part, she focuses on China's skyscrapers and urban development, and there are also celebratory farmers, representing the country's progress in poverty alleviation.
Ghasemi said that she is very interested in China, through movies, documentaries, and other ways to learn about China, which explains the complicated image in her painting.
Mehrnaz Tolouei, the first prize winner in the 7-11 age group, painted a scene of ancient Persians trading with the Chinese on the ancient Silk Road routes, an idea inspired by his father, Mahmoud Tolouei.
""The ancient Silk Road connected China and Iran,"" he said, ""the two countries today enjoy a friendly relationship and their cultures should be reunited again to reconnect"" through these routes.
Chinese Ambassador to Iran Chang Hua said that people-to-people and cultural exchanges between China and Iran have become increasingly close and active, further deepening mutual understanding and traditional friendship between the two peoples.
This year's competition demonstrates Iranian youth's longing for China and their expectation for the continuance of China-Iran traditional friendship, Chang said, expressing his hope that the contest will serve as a starting point to further sow the seeds of friendship between the young people of the two countries so that China-Iran friendship will be passed on from generation to generation.
Noting that Iranian literary and artistic works contain a lot of Chinese stories and elements, Hamed Alamati, Kanoon's general manager, said that his institute stands ready to work with the Chinese embassy to further bolster the exchanges between the young people of the two countries with painting, a common artistic language of mankind, and constantly enhance their mutual understanding.
Such efforts will ""add new strength to the long-standing friendly exchanges between the two countries,"" Alamati added.

With its 90 percent COVID-19 vaccination rate, China's decision to reopen its borders is not irresponsible, he said. In most European countries the same decision was made when the vaccination rate was around 70 percent only.
BUDAPEST, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- A Hungarian expert spoke highly of China's reaction to the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic and said he was optimistic about the Chinese government's new anti-COVID measures.
""China reacted well in the early stages of the pandemic, when it stopped the spread of the virus with national lockdowns and mass testing, and began developing its own vaccines,"" Zoltan Kiszelly, director of the Center of Political Analyses at Hungary's Szazadveg Institute, told Xinhua in a recent interview.
China's health industry made a significant contribution to the global response to COVID-19 by exporting personal protective equipment (face masks, clothing) and syringes, according to Kiszelly.
The delivery from China to Hungary of hundreds of thousands of doses of the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine in 2021 greatly contributed to the rapid and mass immunization of the Hungarian population, said the expert.

It also helped Hungary to reopen after lifting the lockdown earlier than many other countries of Western Europe, he said.
The expert emphasized that in the early stages of the pandemic, China donated its own vaccine to allied third-world countries, which slowed the spread of the virus and helped the immunization of health workers and critical infrastructure workers.
Kiszelly also praised China for obtaining the World Health Organization's (WHO) authorization for its Sinopharm vaccine, which enabled people to freely travel in Europe.
It would be beneficial if the WHO, China, India, the United States, Russia and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) coordinated their licensing practices, he noted.

""I am optimistic about the Chinese government's pandemic prevention and control measures, as China can draw on the experience of other countries and regions, and the organization of the country, the discipline of the Chinese people, and the performance capacity of the Chinese economy provide the necessary tools, logistics and public cooperation for the new phase of the fight against the pandemic,"" he said.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- Members of a paralyzed U.S. House of Representatives reconvened Wednesday noon to elect a new speaker after a chaotic opening day of the divided 118th Congress.
U.S. Congressman Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, failed to secure enough votes on three ballots on Tuesday afternoon because about 20 House lawmakers of his own party picked other candidates for speaker.
It was the first time a House speaker -- who maintains order, manages its proceedings, and governs the administration of its business on the lower chamber's floor -- hadn't been elected on the first ballot in 100 years.

McCarthy has the support of most House Republicans and former U.S. President Donald Trump but a handful of hardliners have opposed his bid to lead the conference by arguing that he is insufficiently conservative while refusing to decentralize the speaker's power.
Trump reaffirmed his support for McCarthy on Wednesday morning, urging Republican House members to elect him and not to ""turn a great triumph into a giant &embarrassing defeat"" in a social media post.

The House has elected a speaker 127 times since 1789. There have been 14 instances of speaker elections requiring multiple ballots.
Thirteen of 14 multiple-ballot elections occurred before the Civil War, when party divisions were more nebulous, according to congressional historians. The last time a speaker election required two or more votes on the floor happened in 1923.
This time, all House Democrats have voted for Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, to be speaker.

U.S. Apollo 7 astronaut Walter Cunningham dies at 90,"HOUSTON, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. astronaut Walt Cunningham, who flew into space on Apollo 7, the first crewed Apollo flight, died at 90 on Tuesday in Houston, according to a news release from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
""On Apollo 7, the first launch of a crewed Apollo mission, Walt and his crewmates made history, paving the way for the Artemis Generation we see today,"" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson.
Cunningham died of complications of a fall, his family said. A public memorial service will be held on Jan. 24 in Houston.
Cunningham, who called being an astronaut ""one of the world's greatest jobs ever,"" was a U.S. Marine Corps fighter pilot before becoming an astronaut in 1963 as part of NASA's third astronaut class.
He was designated the lunar module pilot for the 11-day flight of Apollo 7, which launched on Oct. 11, 1968 and was the first human flight test of the Apollo spacecraft. With Walter Schirra and Donn Eisele, he tested maneuvers necessary for docking and lunar orbit rendezvous using the third stage of their Saturn IB launch vehicle, according to NASA.
The crew successfully completed eight tests, igniting the service module engine, measuring the accuracy of performance of all spacecraft systems, and providing the first live television transmission of onboard crew activities. The 263-hour and 4.5-million-mile flight splashed down on Oct. 22, 1968 in the Atlantic Ocean.
""Walt Cunningham was a fighter pilot, physicist, and an entrepreneur -- but, above all, he was an explorer,"" Nelson said. ""NASA will always remember his contributions to our nation's space program and sends our condolences to the Cunningham family.""
""The world has lost another true hero, and we will miss him dearly,"" the Cunningham family said in a statement.
Born on March 16, 1932, Cunningham received a bachelor of arts with honors in physics in 1960 and a master of arts with distinction in physics in 1961 from the University of California at Los Angeles. He then completed a doctorate in physics with exception of thesis at the Advanced Management Program in the Harvard Business School in 1974.
He joined the U.S. Navy in 1951 and served on active duty with the U.S. Marine Corps, retiring with the rank of colonel. He has accumulated more than 4,500 hours of flying time in 40 different aircraft, including more than 3,400 in jet aircraft.
Cunningham retired from NASA in 1971 and went on to lead multiple technical and financial organizations. He also was a longtime investor and entrepreneur, organizing small businesses and private investment firms.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of Representatives adjourned on Tuesday evening after its members failed to elect a speaker for the lower chamber.
U.S. Congressman Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, failed to secure enough votes in three ballots earlier in the day after a group of House Republicans voted against him.
There will be at least a fourth vote as House members agreed to adjourn until Wednesday noon. McCarthy is reportedly negotiating with fellow Republicans on Tuesday night.
The political drama came nearly two months after the 2022 midterm elections, in which Republicans flipped the House and Democrats held onto their majority in the Senate.
HISTORICALLY DIVIDED CONGRESS
This was the first time in a century that the U.S. House speaker was not elected on the first ballot.
The House will have to vote on and on until a speaker is elected with a majority of votes. A candidate needs 218 votes to become speaker if no lawmaker skips the vote or votes ""present.""
All House Democrats voted for Congressman Hakeem Jeffries from New York to lead the Democratic minority in the three rounds of voting on the speakership.
It also followed the convening of the new and divided Congress on Tuesday noon.
Jemele Hill, a contributing writer for The Atlantic, tweeted on Tuesday afternoon that ""what we're witnessing today in American politics is just another brutal indictment of this dysfunctional political system.""
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that U.S. President Joe Biden, a former six-term senator from Delaware, ""will not insert himself in that process.""

""The president served as a U.S. senator for 34 years and he understands how this process works,"" Jean-Pierre said.
U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris presided over the opening day of the Senate -- where Democrats have a slim 51-49 majority over Republicans -- when she swore in 35 either newly elected or reelected senators Tuesday afternoon.
Chuck Schumer from New York and Mitch McConnell from Kentucky, both Senate veterans, remain the chamber's majority leader and minority leader, respectively.
PUBLIC TRUST IN CONGRESS AT LOW LEVEL
U.S. Congressman-elect George Santos, a 34-year-old Republican from New York, is among those who are waiting to be sworn in after the speaker vote.
Santos has recently admitted to lying about his educational history and professional biography but rejected bipartisan calls for him not to take office.
""My sins here are embellishing my resume. I'm sorry,"" embattled Santos acknowledged last week while alleging that the controversy would not deter him ""from having good legislative success.""
Former U.S. Congresswoman and Fox News contributor Tulsi Gabbard commented, ""Washington has created a culture where it's acceptable to lie to further your own interest.""
""But even when politicians do get caught, people just shrug their shoulders and move on,"" Gabbard continued. ""So, no one should be surprised that the American people don't trust these politicians.""
Public trust in the U.S. Congress reached an all-time low, with only 7 percent of Americans expressing ""a great deal"" or ""quite a lot"" of confidence in it, according to a Gallup poll released in the summer of 2022.
A separate survey that Gallup conducted following last year's midterm elections suggested that Americans' approval of Congress remains largely negative, with 73 percent of U.S. adults expressing disapproval.
The divided Congress with Republicans controlling the House is likely to stall Biden's legislative agenda in the next two years.
In addition, top House Republicans have vowed to launch a series of investigations into the Democratic administration, poised to augment partisan discord on Capitol Hill.
""Our politics has gotten so angry, so mean, so partisan,"" Biden said late last year. ""And too often we see each other as enemies, not as neighbors; as Democrats or Republicans, not as fellow Americans. We've become too divided.""

SHIJIAZHUANG, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- A medical team of 21 members departed Wednesday from Shijiazhuang, the capital of north China's Hebei Province, for the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) for a one-year medical aid mission.
The team members are mainly from the provincial and municipal hospitals and the provincial center for disease control and prevention in Hebei, covering 12 departments, including internal medicine, surgery, orthopedics, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).
""We will earnestly fulfill our duties and coordinate with local medical workers to treat patients and popularize health knowledge,"" said Yang Wu, the team leader.
This year marks the 50th anniversary of Hebei's medical aid work in foreign countries. The province has sent 21 medical teams to the DRC and 14 teams to Nepal, respectively.

TEHRAN, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranians gathered on Tuesday across the country to remember former commander Qassem Soleimani who was assassinated by the United States in January 2020.
During a ceremony marking the 3rd anniversary of Soleimani's assassination in the capital Tehran, the crowds waved Iranian flags and chanted anti-American slogans.
""We have not forgotten and will not forget about avenging the top commander's blood,"" Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi told the crowds, describing Soleimani as the symbol of the fight against oppression and global arrogance.

Similar ceremonies were also held in the cities of Esfahan, Yazd and Soleimani's hometown Kerman.
On Jan. 3, 2020, the U.S. military assassinated Soleimani and the deputy commander of Iraq's paramilitary Hashd Shaabi forces Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in a drone strike near the Baghdad International Airport in Iraq. The assassination was condemned by Iran as an act of ""state terrorism.""

Mexican president pledges to urge U.S. to end interventionist policy,"MEXICO CITY, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Tuesday said he will at a summit urge the U.S. government to end the interventionist Monroe Doctrine it has followed for the past 200 years.
As the host of the North American Leaders' Summit next week, Lopez Obrador is set to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau here in the Mexican capital.
Lopez Obrador plans to call on Biden to change the U.S. policy of ""intervening in"" countries throughout the Americas in a bid to dominate the Western Hemisphere.
The Monroe Doctrine, formulated in the early 1800s by then U.S. President James Monroe, ""has been in place for 200 years,"" he told reporters during his daily press conference at the National Palace in Mexico City.
The principle deems any intervention by external powers in the politics of the Americas as a potentially hostile act against the United States, and has been giving Washington reasons to exercise control over Latin America.
""Respect the autonomy and self-determination of the peoples. It is a very important change,"" said Lopez Obrador.
He also aims to propose integrating North America with the rest of the Western Hemisphere economically to promote development and tackle immigration.

Asia-Pacific countries eager to welcome back Chinese tourists,"BANGKOK, Jan. 7 (Xinhua) -- China's recent optimization of its COVID-19 response and gradual restoration of Chinese citizens' overseas travel have enthused those working in the tourism sectors of Asia-Pacific countries.
In the eyes of a Thai tuk-tuk driver who gave his name as Mak, the return of Chinese tourists means the revival of Thailand's economy. He hopes the hustle and bustle of foreign tourists on Bangkok's streets before the pandemic hit three years ago would soon come back.
GOVERNMENTS' EXPECTATIONS
In 2019, Thailand welcomed about 40 million foreign tourists, nearly 30 percent of whom were Chinese tourists.
Thai Finance Minister Arkhom Termpittayapaisith said that China's gradual restoration of its citizens' overseas travel and other favorable factors could boost Thailand's tourism sector, Thailand's key economic growth contributor, pushing the Thai economy to grow 3.8 percent in 2023.
Philippine President Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr. invited the Chinese people to visit his country as tourists, students and investors. ""I shall push for the resumption of tourism and cultural cooperation between our two countries,"" he said.
Indonesian Tourism and Creative Economy Minister Sandiaga Uno said the COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge negative impact on many sectors of Indonesia, including tourism.
""We lost almost 1 million plus job,"" he said, adding that cooperation with China is very important for the recovery of Indonesia's tourism sector.
Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen said he was very pleased to welcome back Chinese tourists, saying that their presence is vital to the country's tourism and economic growth.
""When China reopens its borders, flights will increase many times, so we hope to welcome about 2 million Chinese tourists again (in 2023),"" Hun Sen said.
TOURISM SECTOR PREPARATIONS
The tourism sectors of Asia-Pacific countries have been gearing up for the return of Chinese tourists in the new year.
In New Zealand, some travel agencies have been communicating with their Chinese counterparts and customizing the latest tour itineraries for the coming Chinese tourists.
Li Ruiqin, managing director of China Travel Service (NZ) Ltd., said Chinese tourists spend an average of 4,900 NZ dollars (about 3,064 U.S. dollars) per person when staying in New Zealand.
The orderly resumption of outbound travel for Chinese tourists will be ""a major boon to New Zealand's tourism industry,"" she said.
Travel specialist He Qingyuan in Australia said as the Chinese Lunar New Year is around the corner, he, along with his peers, is customizing exclusive tours for Chinese visitors.
Yuthasak Supasorn, governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, said the tourism sector is gearing up for the return of Chinese tourists. Besides their favorite activities of visiting beaches and enjoying the food, ""we would like to promote exclusive tour packages in the northeast region, the less trampled corner of Thailand filled with natural beauty and authentic Thainess,"" he said.
On the world-famous Boracay island in the central Philippines, the once-closed Chinese restaurants have been reopening one by one, and some local travel agencies have produced tour packages themed around the Chinese Lunar New Year, hoping to lure the first batch of Chinese tourists after the border reopens.
Indonesia's ""paradise on Earth,"" Bali island, is no exception. Azril Azahari, chairman of the Indonesia Tourism Intellectual Association, said he expects an early arrival of Chinese tourists to Bali to enjoy the upgraded and diversified travel services.
RATIONAL APPROACH NEEDED
China's recent announcement that it would downgrade the management of COVID-19 from Class A to Class B from Jan. 8 has been warmly welcomed by many countries, which have also called for rational pandemic prevention measures.
Welcoming Chinese visitors, Hun Sen said China's upcoming reopening of its borders will revitalize Cambodia's economy and tourism, adding his country will not impose restrictions on Chinese tourists.
In a statement on Wednesday, Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said Thailand has considered COVID-19 a communicable disease under surveillance.
Foreign visitors entering Thailand from all parts of the world will be treated equally and no special public health measures will be implemented to discourage travelers from any particular country.
Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hoch School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore, said Singapore has a high vaccination rate and it is unnecessary for it to impose additional travel regulations on Chinese tourists.

TUNIS, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- China's latest COVID-19 response measures are warmly welcomed by hoteliers and travel agents in Tunisia, which are gearing up for the coming of Chinese guests.
China has optimized its COVID-19 response, with restrictions on international flights to be lifted starting from Jan. 8.
Amir Ben Aribia, general manager of the travel company Tunisia Blue Sky, told Xinhua that he is so happy to hear the good news, as Chinese customers contribute most of the company's business.
Amir is a second-generation tourism practitioner whose father, a travel guide with years of experience, founded his own company, namely Tunisia Blue Sky, in 1996.
The company started to receive Chinese tourists in 2013. Before the pandemic, roughly 90 percent of their clients came from China.
""The Chinese market is huge and growing fast. Chinese people travel all over the world,"" Amir said.
Nowadays, China is not only the largest travel market worldwide but also one of the biggest spenders globally.
At its peak in 2019, Chinese citizens made 155 million outbound trips. According to London-based The Economist, one in 10 international tourists was Chinese before the pandemic.
""Compared with Europeans, who prefer summer holidays at the seaside, Chinese show more interest in historical sites and natural landscapes, such as the ruins of ancient Carthage and the Sahara desert,"" Amir said, adding that this has brought them a significant and stable income.
In 2017, Tunisia started to offer visa-free entry to Chinese tourists. Since then, China has emerged as one of Tunisia's fast-growing markets, with Chinese tourist arrivals rising from about 7,400 in 2016 to over 18,000 in 2017.
""Before visa exemptions, Chinese travelers rarely came to Tunisia. But now, more and more people flock to the North African country,"" Cai Feifei, Tunisia representative at SaishangTour, a travel services company headquartered in Beijing, told Xinhua.
She said Chinese tourists especially enjoy spending the nights in tents in the Sahara desert.
Bordering the Sahara desert and the Mediterranean Sea, Tunisia is renowned for its rich tourism resources.
Tourism is a mainstay of Tunisia's economy. From 2015 to 2019, 7.2 million arrivals per year made it one of the most visited countries in Africa, according to WorldData. Internet statistics company Statista showed that tourism generated 10 percent of its gross domestic product in 2022.
The COVID-19 pandemic had dealt a dramatic blow to the country's tourism industry. In 2020, revenues were down 62 percent to 1.01 billion dollars.
For Amir, the worst time is over. He and his colleagues are preparing for the arrival of a new wave of Chinese travelers in 2023.
""As more Chinese tourists are expected to come, we do hope that there will be direct flights between China and Tunisia one day,"" he said.

Bitter battle over U.S. House speakership resumes on 2nd anniversary of Capitol riot,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- The bitter battle over the speakership of the U.S. House of Representatives resumed on Friday against the backdrop of the second anniversary of the Capitol riot.
U.S. Congressman Kevin McCarthy from California, the House Republican leader, fell short of the necessary votes to take the speaker gavel in 11 ballots over the past three days, making the contest the longest in 164 years.
The House kicked off the 12th round of voting on Friday afternoon as the historic deadlock drags on, paralyzing the lower chamber three days after the new and divided 118th Congress convened.
""I'm not telling you we have an agreement,"" McCarthy reportedly said on Friday morning, adding that he and his opponents -- most of them conservative hardliners -- ""have meetings.""
U.S. Congressman Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, is a leading opponent to McCarthy. His press office dismissed reports that a deal had been reached between the two sides on Friday morning.
""Any agreement will take us ALL,"" Roy's press aides tweeted. ""We are making progress... but don't let the sharks confuse the ongoing engagement.""
Earlier in the day, House Democrats and -- reportedly only one Republican -- gathered on the steps of the Capitol, located at the eastern end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C., to mark the second anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack.
Exactly two years ago, a large group of supporters of outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump violently stormed the Capitol and disrupted a joint session of Congress to affirm the results of the 2020 presidential election in which Democrat Joe Biden won.
Some of the rioters chanted ""Hang Mike Pence"" while making their way into the Capitol. Pence, then U.S. vice president presiding over the procedure to formally verify Biden's victory, was rushed out of the building by Secret Service agents to a secure location.
Panicked lawmakers took shelter and crouched behind chairs in the House gallery after the chaos broke out and shocked the United States and the rest of the world.
Approximately 140 police officers were assaulted in the worst attack on the U.S. Capitol in more than 200 years to which at least five deaths have been linked. Over 900 individuals have been arrested in nearly all 50 states for crimes related to the breach of the landmark complex.

"Democratic officials' homes, offices shot in U.S. state New Mexico","HOUSTON, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- Five local Democratic elected officials' homes or offices have been shot in a string of gunfire over the past month in Albuquerque, the largest city of southwestern U.S. state New Mexico. An investigation is underway.
""We're worried and concerned that these are connected and possibly politically motivated or personally motivated ... but we don't know that for a fact,"" Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller said at a press conference via the Albuquerque Police Department's Facebook livestream.
During the shootings, multiple rounds have been fired into the doors and walls of these officials' homes or offices, in some cases while the officials were inside with their families. No one has been hurt.
The FBI, together with the state and local police, are trying to determine if the attacks are connected.
According to the Albuquerque Police Department, the first shooting occurred on Dec. 4, 2022, at the home of Bernalillo County Commissioner Adriann Barboa. Someone shot eight rounds at his house.
On Dec. 10, ShotSpotter technology detected several gunshots in the area of New Mexico Attorney General Raul Torrez's former campaign office, where the attorney general had already moved out following his November election.
One day later, the home of then Bernalillo Commissioner Debbie O'Malley came under fire. More than a dozen gunshot impacts were identified on walls and the house.
Earlier this week, state Senator Linda Lopez's home was hit by at least eight shots after midnight.
On Thursday morning, police responded a report of gun shots heard in the area of a downtown law office where state Senator Moe Maestas works. The police department's ShotSpotter system registered three shots fired at the same location though officers did not find any damage to the building.
""We're grateful that nobody has been injured, but we also realize that we have to move quickly,"" Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina said at the news conference Thursday afternoon.
The attacks have been difficult to process, ""especially knowing that other women of color elected officials have also been targeted,"" Barboa told NPR on Friday.
The shootings occurred nearly two years after a large group of supporters of then U.S. President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, 2021, and disrupted a joint session of Congress to affirm the 2020 presidential election results.

Despite crises and challenges, peace and development, fairness and win-win cooperation will remain the common aspiration of people all over the world.
BEIJING, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- As changes unseen in a century are unfolding at a rapid pace, the world's seven major regions, namely the Asia-Pacific, North America, Europe, Eurasia, the Middle East, Latin America and Africa, will see a mix of tailwinds and headwinds in 2023.
The world is not yet a tranquil place and humanity can't pretend that all problems will go away in the new year. Yet despite crises and challenges, peace and development, fairness and win-win cooperation will remain the common aspiration of people all over the world.
A tough year has gone by. A new start is in front of the world.
ASIA-PACIFIC: SEEKING COOPERATION WHILE RESISTING INTERFERENCE
In 2023, the Asia-Pacific will continue to enjoy a relatively stable security situation, robust economic growth and strong desire for cooperation. At the same time, certain countries' persistent interference to other countries' internal affairs will pose a grave challenge to regional peace and stability.
Over the past year, the United States has continued to advance the so-called ""Indo-Pacific strategy"" in the region. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has gathered allies and some regional countries to strengthen the ""small circle"" against China.
In 2023, only by strengthening the will to maintain regional stability and deepening mutual trust can the Asia-Pacific region cement the foundation of regional security and drive the global recovery forwards.

In 2023, which marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative, China is considering hosting the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. India takes over the rotating presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Group of 20. Indonesia holds the rotating chair of ASEAN ... Asia will once again capture spotlight for promoting global governance. The Asian-Pacific countries have full confidence in the ""China engine,"" regional development and future cooperation.
EUROPE: MULTIPLE TESTS AHEAD
2023 will be a year full of uncertainties for Europe. Since the start of the Ukraine crisis, the European Union (EU) has shown ""solidarity"" with the United States out of security concerns and has imposed nine rounds of sanctions on Russia, which have backfired.
In 2023, the wisdom of Europe will be tested whether it will continue to follow the United States and exert maximum pressure on Russia, or strengthen its strategic independence and seek to ease its confrontation with Moscow.

In 2023, Europe's energy crisis remains difficult to be eased. The energy crisis and high inflation will worsen its economic outlook. According to the European Commission, economic activity in the EU, the euro area and most member states is expected to keep contracting in the first quarter of 2023.
Faced with many challenges, how to further promote China-EU relations has become more urgent for European countries in 2023. There is a sound foundation for the growth of China-EU relations: China remains the EU's largest trading partner, while the EU is China's second-largest trading partner. In addition, Chinese and EU leaders are in close communication, showing their willingness to jointly strengthen strategic communication and coordination to boost the China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership.
NORTH AMERICA: GROWING POLITICAL POLARIZATION IN U.S.
As U.S. politicians prepare for the 2024 presidential election in 2023, the partisan wrangling in the United States could be further polarized. Washington's adherence to the Cold War mentality in geopolitics and major-country relations may further disrupt the international order.
Meanwhile, U.S. economic policies could have significant spillover effect on the world economy. There is widespread concern in the international community about the possibility of a recession in the United States.

Over the years, the United States has kept saying that it does not seek conflict or a new Cold War but doesn't walk its talk. In the Asia-Pacific, the United States has set up a ""quadrilateral mechanism"" with Japan, India and Australia, a trilateral security partnership AUKUS with Australia and Britain, and an ""Indo-Pacific Economic framework"" to ""decouple"" from China. In Europe, Washington has continuously inflamed the Ukraine crisis, which has not only worsened the security situation in Europe, but also affected international peace and security. If Washington continues to say one thing and do another in 2023, it will create new divisions and further disrupt the international order.
EURASIA: MOVING FORWARD DESPITE UNCERTAINTIES
For countries in the region, the Ukraine crisis will still be the biggest pain point in 2023.
Han Lu, deputy director of the Department for European-Central Asian Studies of the China Institute of International Studies, said the West will not give up the opportunity to suppress and weaken Russia and will do everything possible to continue its proxy war. The geopolitical uncertainty caused by the crisis may further increase.

Nevertheless, regional countries will not stop pursuing political stability, economic development and diplomatic breakthroughs. In the new year, although facing a volatile regional and international environment, they will continue to strengthen cooperation with China.
China-Russia relations, based on non-alignment, non-confrontation and non-targeting of third parties, are rock-solid. China will work with countries in the region to strengthen the high-quality development of the Belt and Road through such projects as the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan Railway and the Line D of the Central Asia-China natural gas pipeline.
MIDDLE EAST: MOVING EASTWARD AS REGION STABILIZES
In 2023, the situation in the Middle East is likely to maintain a momentum of ""relaxing in general with instability in some parts."" Relations among regional countries are expected to keep improving despite uncertainties. In the meantime, Western powers are expected to tighten their grip on the region while speeding up adjusting their Middle East policies.
Tang Zhichao, a scholar at the Institute of West-Asian and African Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the conciliatory atmosphere in the Middle East is sustainable. In 2023, there is great hope for continued peace and stability in the region. But uncertainties are also lying ahead, including whether there will be a breakthrough in negotiations to resume an implementation of the Iran nuclear deal.

With evolving regional political ecology and warming-up of China-Arab relations, the Middle East countries will move faster from ""looking eastward"" to ""heading eastward.""
Tian Wenlin, professor at the School of International Relations at Renmin University of China, said amid great changes unseen in a century, Arab countries face historic opportunities to deepen their cooperation with China. It is foreseeable that in 2023, the relations between the Middle East countries and China will be further upgraded.
LATAM: STRONG LEFT-WING COMEBACK RESHAPES POLITICAL LANDSCAPE
In 2022, many populous countries in Latin America, including Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina, have elected leftist governments. In 2023, the main question in Latin American politics is whether the leftists can consolidate their grip on power by strengthening unity and managing divisions.
The challenge for Latin America's economy in 2023 is whether it can respond effectively to external shocks. In 2022, the U.S. Fed's aggressive interest rate hikes had exacerbated Latin American countries' debt burdens, pushing some into debt crises.

Zhou Mi, deputy director of the Institute of American and Oceanian Study at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation affiliated to the Ministry of Commerce, said that in 2023, Latin American countries need to determine policy direction as soon as possible to attract investment, guide industrial transformation, and strengthen regional economic coordination and integration.
In recent years, Latin American integration has stalled. Following election wins, many leftist governments are attaching more importance to regional solidarity and diplomatic independence, injecting new impetus into Latin American integration.
AFRICA: SEEKING STABILITY &DEVELOPMENT
In 2023, African countries will make further efforts to resolve conflicts, improve the security environment and achieve better economic performance. Li Hongfeng, dean of the School of African Studies at Beijing Foreign Studies University, said Africa's own capacity building is the most crucial part in solving the peace and security issues of the continent.

The African economy is still facing difficulties in the new year, but regional economic recovery is expected to pick up speed in 2023. Digital technology and green economy, among others, are expected to be new growth points for regional economy.
In the new year, African countries will become more active on the international stage thanks to their huge development potential. From the United Nations Security Council reform to climate change and energy supply, Africa as a whole will play a bigger role in international affairs.

Information provided by the Syrian government earlier on terrorist organizations possessing and using chemical weapons must be taken into full account by the Technical Secretariat, he added.
China reiterates its call that the Security Council should reduce the frequency of the considerations on the Syria issue, or consider combining the different tracks of the dossier. This would enable the council to take a holistic approach to the Syria issue and to make the council's work more efficient, said Sun.

Some European countries such as Italy, Spain and France had followed the strategy that China ""effectively put in place in the early phases of the pandemic,"" said Antoine Flahault, director of the Institute of Global Health at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Geneva.
""When the pandemic emerged in Wuhan, the response from the Chinese authorities was quite good,"" Flahault told Xinhua in a video interview. ""The Chinese government did apply very strict and effective measures at the time to tackle the pandemic and to avoid its spread all over the country.""
Before a full deployment of vaccines, China and a lot of countries in the Asia-Pacific region had adopted a zero-COVID strategy, which was ""more effective than the Western response at that time,"" said the expert.
With the mutation of the virus, the popularization of vaccination, and the accumulation of experience in prevention and control, China has announced that it will downgrade management of the disease from Class A to Class B starting from Jan. 8.
From the experience of some countries after adjusting the zero-COVID strategy, a priority for the transitional period is to ""vaccinate the vulnerable segments of the population,"" Flahault said.

Chinese envoy calls for efforts to defuse Israeli-Palestinian tensions over holy site,"UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese envoy on Thursday called on the parties concerned to exercise restraint to prevent escalation of tensions following new Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir's visit to the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in East Jerusalem.
China is deeply worried about the rise of tensions as a result of Ben-Gvir's visit, said Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations.
In recent years, unilateral actions at the holy site in East Jerusalem have intensified problems and confrontations, triggering bloody conflicts many times. This truly reflects the sensitivity of the character and status of the holy site, he told the Security Council.
""China calls for the restoration and maintenance of peace and tranquility at the holy site, and calls on parties concerned to remain calm and restrained to prevent further escalation of tensions,"" said Zhang. ""Israel, in particular, should stop all incitements and provocations, and should refrain from any unilateral action that may lead to the deterioration of the situation.""
China stands for upholding international rule of law and abiding by the international consensus on Jerusalem. Security Council resolutions unequivocally condemn all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem. The parties concerned should earnestly maintain the status quo of the holy site in Jerusalem and respect Jordan's custodianship, as set out in relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, he said.
Having noticed the Israeli leader's expression of commitment to maintaining the status quo of the holy site, China hopes this commitment can be translated into constructive policies and actions, he said.
What underlies the repeated cycles of tensions between Palestinians and Israelis is the repeatedly delayed implementation of the two-state solution. Facts have proved once again that piecemeal crisis management can hardly play an effective role, much less can it replace a comprehensive and just solution, said Zhang.
The international community should, with a sense of urgency, promote the resumption of peace talks between Palestinians and Israelis as soon as possible on the basis of the two-state solution, resolve Jerusalem and other final-status issues, and realize the peaceful coexistence of Palestine and Israel at an early date. Countries of significant influence should assume responsibility and effectively play a constructive role, he said.

U.S. House adjourns with no speaker elected despite longest election in 164 years,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of Representatives voted to adjourn until noon on Friday with no speaker elected on Thursday after 11 rounds of voting.
U.S. Congressman Kevin McCarthy from California, the House Republican leader, fell short of the necessary votes to take the gavel in five more rounds of voting Thursday afternoon.
The House has voted 11 times since the 118th Congress convened on Tuesday, making it the longest speaker contest in 164 years.
The 435-seat lower chamber, where Republicans have a slim majority over Democrats, is unable to conduct any legislative business until a speaker is elected.
McCarthy has the support of most House Republicans and former U.S. President Donald Trump but a handful of hardliners have pressured him to decentralize the speaker's power.
All House Democrats have voted for Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, to be speaker in the election.
Though it's unlikely for Jeffries to attain the position, he is set to become the first African American lawmaker to lead a party in either chamber of the U.S. Congress.
Republicans flipped the House in the 2022 midterm elections and Democrats held onto their majority in the Senate.
U.S. President Joe Biden said Wednesday that it's ""embarrassing for the country"" not to have a fully functional Congress, the legislature of the federal government.

In December 2022, Ukraine's GDP declined 34 percent due to a certain stabilization of the situation with energy supply, after a fall of 37 percent in November, the ministry said.
In the fourth quarter of last year, Ukraine's economy experienced a decline of 35.5 percent compared with the same period in 2021, it said.

U.S. gov't announces measures to crack down on illegal immigration,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government announced Thursday new measures to crack down on illegal immigration.
The measures will ""expand and expedite legal pathways for orderly migration"" and ""result in new consequences for those who fail to use those legal pathways,"" said the White House.
Individuals who ""attempt to enter the United States without permission, do not have a legal basis to remain, and cannot be expelled pursuant to Title 42"" will be increasingly subject to expedited removal to their country of origin and subject to a five-year ban on re-entry, according to the White House release.
Title 42 is a U.S. public health authority that also allows border officials to swiftly expel migrants and asylum-seekers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Before asking Congress for funding on Thursday, U.S. President Joe Biden said from the White House that the country's immigration system is ""broken."" He will travel to El Paso, Texas, to assess border enforcement operations on Sunday.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott and at least two other Republican governors sent thousands of migrants from their states to cities led by Democrats last year to protest against the Biden administration's immigration policies and what they called federal inaction to secure America's southern border.

"Indian capital records nearly 4,500 dengue cases, 9 related deaths in 2022","NEW DELHI, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- Indian capital New Delhi recorded 4,469 cases of dengue and nine related deaths in 2022, data released by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) on Thursday showed.
As per data, the highest number of dengue cases in Delhi were logged in October with 1,238 cases and November with 1,420 cases. In the month of December, 874 cases were reported, the data showed.
Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that has rapidly spread in all regions in recent years. The virus is transmitted by female mosquitoes.
Health experts say those who become infected with the virus a second time are at a significantly greater risk of developing severe disease. It causes fever, body aches, nausea, vomiting, internal bleeding, or a fatal drop in blood pressure in severe cases.
In 2021, according to MCD, Delhi reported 9,613 dengue cases and 23 related deaths. Likewise in 2020, the number of dengue cases recorded in Delhi was 1,072, and one related death.
Health experts say cases of vector-borne diseases such as dengue and malaria are usually reported between July and November, sometimes stretching until mid-December.

Interview: China's optimized COVID-19 strategy gives new hope to global economic recovery: Thai expert,"BANGKOK, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- As China is the major growth engine for economic development of the Asia-Pacific and the wider world, its optimized COVID-19 strategy has injected fresh imputes into the global economic recovery, a Thai expert has said.
Noting that the COVID-19 pandemic has been a global disaster for human society, Wirun Phichaiwongphakdee, director of the Thailand-China Research Center of the Belt and Road Initiative, said in a recent interview with Xinhua that the Chinese government has constantly optimized its COVID-19 response measures based on the evolvement of the pandemic and the deepening study on the virus.
China's COVID-19 response measures have been science-based and a testimony to putting the people's interests first -- nothing being more precious than people's lives, he said, adding that China has played an indispensable role in the global fight against the pandemic and recovery of the world economy.
The swift and decisive measures undertaken by the Chinese government to contain the outbreak at the very beginning have won precious time for other countries, he said.
""The time that China has won for others and its experience to contain the outbreak were very precious for the neighboring countries and the wider world to prepare for the pandemic.""
He said China's constant adjustment and optimization of pandemic response measures are based on the increasing scientific understanding of the virus and the disease.
Wirun, who has inoculated the COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by China, said he has been impressed by China's solidarity and cooperation with the global community in overcoming the pandemic.
China has provided COVID-19 vaccines to many developing countries, including Thailand, he said, adding that the vaccines arrived at the height of the pandemic in his country and have played a critical role in Thailand's efforts to contain the outbreak.
""As Thailand is an aging society, more people could have lost their lives without these Chinese vaccines and other assistance provided by China.""
The resumption of work and production in China has played a vital role in providing other countries with critical supplies in fighting COVID-19 and their subsequent efforts to achieve economic recovery.
""China is the major growth engine for economic development of the Asia-Pacific and the world, and its manufacturing sectors are known for high quality and high efficiency.""
""Without 'Made in China', the global economic recovery would have been a non-starter,"" he added.
Wirun also pointed out that the cooperation under the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative has enhanced relations between China and countries in its neighborhood, including Thailand. The China-Laos Railway, for example, has boosted regional connectivity, according to him.
As China's optimized COVID-19 strategy takes effect, people-to-people exchanges and the connectivity between China and other parts of the world will be further strengthened, and the world will see a new hope for recovery, he said.
China recently announced that it would downgrade its management of the infectious disease of COVID-19 from Class A to Class B, starting from Jan. 8, 2023, shifting the focus of the response from stemming infection to caring for infected patients and preventing severe cases.

Looking ahead to 2023, solutions remain in sight to these seemingly intractable problems so long as countries jointly deliver real, concrete actions.
BEIJING, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- The year of 2022 saw a world in turmoil: the United States fueled one conflict after another, the Ukraine crisis dragged on, the COVID-19 pandemic lingered on with Omicron emerging as the new strain.
Inflation, food crisis, energy security, a sluggish world economic recovery, a worrisome climate and stalled climate negotiations ... These overlapping challenges have tested humanity beyond measure.
Looking ahead to 2023, solutions remain in sight to these seemingly intractable problems so long as countries jointly deliver real, concrete actions.
THE UKRAINE CRISIS
The crisis in Ukraine escalated on Feb. 24, 2022, when Russia launched a special military operation against Ukraine. Since then, the U.S.-led West has continued to provide military and economic aid to Ukraine, turning the conflict into a protracted one. The United States and its allies have also imposed tough sanctions on Russia on an unprecedented scale, but have failed to crush the Russian economy.

At present, the Russian and Ukrainian forces are basically caught in a stalemate. Due to huge divisions between the two sides, it is difficult to resolve the crisis through negotiations in the short term.
The United States continued to fan the flame by announcing an additional 1.85 billion U.S. dollars in military aid to Ukraine, including the Patriot air defense system. The U.S. Congress also passed recently the omnibus bill for 2023, which includes up to 45 billion dollars in emergency funding for Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russia lately signaled a military buildup by announcing plans to beef up its armed forces to 1.5 million from 1.15 million.
It remains unpredictable whether the crisis will come to an end or escalate further in 2023, the evolvement of which largely hinges on whether the Western countries can withstand the enormous burden on their economies and national defense from continued aid to Ukraine.
THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
Over the past year, Omicron, a mutated new coronavirus variant, has become the dominant strain in the global pandemic. Omicron is more infectious than previously prevalent strains, has multiple subtypes, and has triggered waves of new outbreaks in countries around the world. However, its pathogenicity is significantly lower, and so is the rate of serious illness and mortality due to infection, prompting countries around the world to gradually adjust their epidemic prevention policies.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has recently voiced his hope of declaring COVID-19 no longer a global health emergency sometime in 2023, and a WHO emergency committee will meet in January to discuss the criteria for declaring such an end.
To battle COVID, scientists around the world are making unremitting efforts to develop next-generation vaccines and antiviral drugs. With the progress of the research and development of COVID vaccine and drugs, humankind will be armed with more weapons against viruses and a strong shield against COVID.
BATTERED WORLD ECONOMY
In 2022, the world economy is beset by multiple difficulties, especially inflation, which has hamstrung many countries. The U.S.-led Western countries have previously implemented ultra-loose monetary policy for a long time to cope with the pandemic and stimulate the economy, sowing the seeds for skyrocketing inflation.
Following the escalation of the Ukraine crisis, Western sanctions against Russia further obstructed the international supply chain already disrupted by the pandemic. The hiking energy and food prices further pushed up inflation, and the price rise of commodities in many European and American countries hit a 40-year high.
To curb inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates swiftly and aggressively, causing other economies' currencies to depreciate sharply and fueling their imported inflation. Many countries have been forced to follow the United States in raising interest rates, triggering fears of recession.
In its World Economic Outlook report released in October 2022, the International Monetary Fund projects global economic growth at 2.7 percent in 2023, down 0.2 percentage points from its July forecast, with the global economy facing significant downside risks.
However, with the release of pent-up demand and the combination of policy effects, China's economy will show clear momentum for recovery and growth, which will add sustained impetus and bring opportunities and confidence to the world economy.
POLITICALLY DIVIDED U.S.
In 2022, the U.S. Democratic and Republican parties continued their bickering, with deep rifts on a range of issues, including abortion rights, gun control and immigration. In the midterm elections held in November 2022, Republicans seized control of the House of Representatives, while Democrats narrowly retained control of the Senate.

With both parties eyeing the 2024 presidential election and the new Congress ""divided"" between the House and the Senate, the Republican Party is expected to pose more challenges to the Joe Biden administration in 2023, leaving its current domestic and foreign policies in a welter of great uncertainty.
The strife within the Republican Party is also likely to intensify. Moderates in the Republican Party may consider dropping their support for Donald Trump, who is planning to run for president in the next election but did poorly in the midterms. Meanwhile, Republicans' narrow majority in the House of Representatives may give the party's extremist wing more opportunity to sway its position in Congress.
Amid political polarization and intensified infighting, U.S. politics remain shrouded by uncertainties, which will affect the U.S. foreign policy and bring about more complexities to the world.
THE ASIA-PACIFIC
In 2022, under U.S. interference, many countries in the Asia-Pacific faced varying degrees of shocks and mounting regional tensions.
One year after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, Afghanistan is still mired in a grave security and humanitarian crisis. On the Korean Peninsula, tensions escalated after the United States and South Korea repeatedly held large-scale joint military drills, prompting the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to counter with missile launches. With the support of the United States, Japan has recently officially adopted three key defense documents including a new version of the National Security Strategy, which proposes to build a so-called ""counterstrike capability,"" a de facto pre-emptive attack capability, and will significantly increase military spending in the next five years, arousing concern in the international community.
Foreseeably, the United States will continue to form cliques and foment trouble in the Asia-Pacific region. Peace will remain a luxury in the region in 2023.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Climate change is a major challenge facing humanity. In 2022, the mega-floods in Pakistan killed more than 1,000 people. The summer heat and drought in Europe dried up the headwaters of the Thames and nearly shut down the Rhine. The recent winter storms that nearly swept across the United States have killed dozens of people. These appalling extreme weather events serve as a grim reminder that it brooks no delay to tackle climate change.

In November 2022, the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP27) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Developed countries remained passive in providing financial and technical support to developing countries, and had yet to deliver their pledged funding of 100 billion dollars a year. As a highlight of the meeting, the conference finally agreed to establish a ""loss and damage"" fund to provide financial assistance to the most vulnerable and hardest hit by climate change, but this is only a first step. Still subject to negotiations in 2023 are key issues such as the form of the fund, funding countries, allocation methods and assistance targets.
Currently, developed economies don't fare well. Confronted with strained energy supply, some developed countries have switched back to coal for power generation and become increasingly unwilling to cut their own emissions and support developing countries in doing so. Under such circumstances, all eyes are on whether the COP28, scheduled for 2023 in Dubai, UAE, will make a difference on the above key issues.

Classified documents found at Biden think tank,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- A special counsel to U.S. President Joe Biden said on Monday that classified documents had been found at a private office here used while he was vice president.
White House special counsel Richard Sauber said the documents were discovered ""when Biden's attorneys were packing files housed in a locked closet to prepare to vacate office space at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, D.C.""
The Penn Biden Center is a think tank not far from the White House, affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania and named for Biden.
Sauber said Biden, a Democrat, periodically used this space from mid-2017 until the start of his 2020 presidential campaign.
The discovery of ""what appears to be Obama-Biden Administration records, including a small number of documents with classified markings"" was made on Nov. 2, 2022.
On that day, the White House Counsel's office notified the National Archives, which took possession of the materials the following morning, said Sauber.
U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland reportedly tasked the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois John Lausch Jr. with reviewing the matter.
The U.S. Department of Justice is also investigating former President Donald Trump's handling of a trove of classified documents seized from his estate in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, by federal agents in the summer of 2022.
Trump, a Republican, responded to the news of classified documents found at the Penn Biden Center, posting Monday on social media that ""when is the FBI going to raid the many homes of Joe Biden, perhaps even the White House?""

China has resumed outbound tourism after downgrading COVID-19 management measures from Class A to B starting on Sunday. The global tourism market has responded warmly to this change and actively welcomed Chinese tourists.
According to Ctrip data, as of Jan 5, overseas travel orders for the seven days during Spring Festival had surged by 540 percent and the average order cost had increased by 32 percent over the same period last year. It is expected that overseas tourist destinations will welcome a large number of Chinese tourists during the holiday.
Industry experts predict China's move will boost the development of global tourism and stimulate economic recovery, as well as promote people-to-people exchanges.
Brighter prospects for tourism
According to United Nations World Tourism Organization, China was one of the world's major outbound tourism contributors before the outbreak of the pandemic. The optimized COVID-19 policy will have a positive impact on the development of tourism in China as well as the world.
Steve Saxon, who leads McKinsey's Travel, Logistics &Infrastructure Practice in China, said China averaged about 12 million outbound air passengers per month in 2019, and predicts that figure will recover to about 6 million per month by the summer.

U.S. House adopts rules package after dysfunctional opening week,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of Representatives adopted a rules package on Monday after the dysfunctional opening week.
The package, which will govern how the House led by Republicans operates for the next two years, was passed in a 220-213 vote, mainly along party lines.
House Speaker Kevin McCarthy -- whose bid to take the gavel last week paralyzed the lower chamber for days -- said on Monday evening that ""Congress has been broken for a long time.""
McCarthy, a California Republican, made multiple concessions to House Republican hardliners in order to rise to the post, including a measure to allow a single member to call for a vote to remove the speaker.
Republicans flipped the House in the 2022 midterm elections while Democrats held onto their majority in the Senate.
The new, divided Congress convened early last week, but McCarthy didn't secure enough votes to become House speaker until the 15th ballot due to intra-party division and partisanship.
The longest House speaker election contest in 164 years prevented Congress from being fully operational.

""Cross-border assistance is a temporary arrangement made under special circumstances, and should ultimately transition, in an orderly manner, to cross-line assistance, so that the latter will become the main channel for humanitarian assistance to Syria,"" he said in an explanation of vote.
To this end, the frequency and the size of convoys of cross-line assistance in Northwest Syria must be significantly increased, and cross-line assistance to the Rukban refugee camp on the border with Jordan should resume as early as possible, he said.
All parties should ensure adequate supplies and funding for cross-line assistance and step up coordination with relevant parties, in particular the parties in de facto control of Northwest Syria, so as to effectively improve the access environment for cross-line assistance, he added.
Vigorous efforts must be made for quality and efficiency gains in early-recovery projects, said Zhang.
At present, the overall funding for early-recovery projects needs to be improved. Early-recovery projects in different sectors are seeing mixed progress, and there are major differences in project implementation among different regions. China urges all donors to put the well-being of all Syrians first and promptly and properly resolve these problems, he said.
The removal of explosive remnants of war is important for restoring the normal work and life of the Syrian people, and should be included in the scope of early recovery as quickly as possible, he said.
Unilateral sanctions impede humanitarian access in Syria and restrict its access to humanitarian resources, running counter to the humanitarian efforts by the Security Council and the international community. China once again urges the relevant countries to immediately and fully lift the unilateral sanctions on Syria, said Zhang.

Indian capital puts curbs on vehicles amid severe air pollution,"NEW DELHI, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- The air pollution level in the Indian capital territory New Delhi on Monday became severe, prompting local authorities to put curbs on some vehicles until Friday, local media reported.
According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the overall air quality index (AQI) turned severe at 444.
""The AQI in Delhi at 8:00 p.m. (local time) today was recorded at 444,"" data released by CPCB said. ""The air quality is very poor and prominent pollutants are PM 2.5 and PM 10.""
Experts say PM 2.5 are fine particles that are 2.5 microns or less in diameter and can travel deep into the respiratory tract, reaching the lungs and entering the bloodstream.
Meanwhile, the local government in view of the worsening air quality in Delhi has decided to impose a temporary ban on plying of BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles in the national capital from Tuesday.
The BS is the short form of Bharat Stage, a government-instituted emission standard for four-wheelers.
Keeping in view the severe category of Delhi's AQI, health experts have advised residents to stop outdoor activity in the early morning and after sunset times, besides avoiding prolonged or heavy exertion.
As per CPCB, AQI between 0 - 50 is considered ""good"", between 51 - 100 ""satisfactory"", between 101 - 200 ""moderate"", between 201 - 300 ""poor"", between 301 - 400 ""very poor"", and between 401 - 500 ""severe"" and beyond 500 is severe plus emergency.
Air pollution continues to worsen in New Delhi and it gets aggravated during winter months. The deterioration in air quality is attributed to slow wind speed and stubble burning (farm fires) in the neighboring states.

Cambodia starts to upgrade national road in SE province with funds from China,"KAMPONG CHAM, Cambodia, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia on Monday broke ground for the expansion and upgrading of National Road 7 here with funds from China in order to cope with rising traffic flows and cargo transport.
The 45.48-km road, stretching from the Skun Market roundabout to the Kizuna Bridge roundabout in Kampong Cham town, will be upgraded and expanded from two to four lanes.
Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen and Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Wang Wentian presided over the groundbreaking ceremony, which was attended by thousands of local people.
Hun Sen said the road is an important economic artery as it is interconnected with other key roads in its neighboring provinces and is also part of the ASEAN Highway 11.
""The expansion and upgrading of the road are crucial to reduce traffic jams, facilitate travel and transportation of agricultural and agro-industrial products, and promote the development of socioeconomic activities in Kampong Cham and its neighboring provinces,"" he said.
Hun Sen said the project was another fruit of close cooperation between Cambodia and China in 2023, which is the Cambodia-China Friendship Year and the year marking the 65th anniversary of the diplomatic relations between the two countries.
""I would like to thank China for having provided a great amount of aid to Cambodia for the development of roads, bridges, irrigation system, and electricity, among others, which have greatly contributed to the country's development,"" he said.
Ambassador Wang said the project was another important achievement of China-Cambodia pragmatic cooperation in the new year.
""Over the years, China has helped Cambodia build power stations, roads, bridges, and hospitals, among others,"" he said. ""These achievements are the fruits of China-Cambodia friendship and have provided a lot of benefits to the people of Cambodia.""
According to the Cambodian Ministry of Public Works and Transport, the road is being developed by China Road and Bridge Corporation under a loan from China. The project is expected to take 40 months to complete.
Eng Sokhon, a 38-year-old soft drink seller along National Road 7, said the project will not only reduce traffic jams, but also facilitate the transport of goods from farms to markets.
""Currently, it's difficult to travel when we are in a hurry because the road is very narrow,"" she told Xinhua.
""I feel happy because when the road is widened, it will be easy to travel to and fro, and we will be able to transport rice, vegetables, fish, and meat from farms to markets easily,"" she added.

According to official sources, over 30 flights originating from or landing in New Delhi were delayed at the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) airport. Around 30 trains approaching the city were also running late as the dense fog hampered the rail traffic.
As a result of low visibility, which was reduced to 0-5 metres in the wee hours of Monday, cars were seen plying on roads with their blinkers and headlights on. A couple of road mishaps were also reported in New Delhi and its adjoining areas in which a few people were injured.
In the past few days, mercury dipped to as low as 1 degree Celsius in parts of north India. Amid the prevailing cold wave conditions, school vacations have been extended till Jan. 15, and people are advised to remain indoors to take precautions against cold.
People can be seen sitting around bonfires along road sides to battle the bone-chilling cold. Around 50 cold-related deaths have been reported from the Kanpur city in northern Uttar Pradesh state over the past few days. Many of these deaths took place due to heart attacks or strokes amid extreme cold conditions, said media reports.

LA PAZ, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) -- The violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol two years ago and the bitter battle over the speakership of the U.S. House of Representatives have shown the world that the American political model is ""outdated,"" former Bolivian foreign minister Fernando Huanacuni has said.
The democratic model of the United States ""is outdated and worn out because it now generates violence and intolerance, with assaults on institutions,"" Huanacuni told Xinhua on Friday.
The U.S. democratic model is in decline now as it has not adapted to the current global reality and the changes that are taking place in the political, social, and economic spheres, said the Bolivian politician.
On Jan. 6, 2021, supporters of outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump violently stormed the Capitol in Washington, D.C., disrupting a joint session of Congress to affirm the results of the 2020 presidential election in which Joe Biden won.
According to the Department of Justice, more than 900 people were arrested for crimes related to the destruction of the Capitol.
And in recent days, there was also an unprecedented lack of consensus over the election of the speaker of the House of Representatives, who failed to be chosen with 14 ballots.
These two events show the fragility of U.S. institutions, which need to adjust to the current times, said Huanacuni.
On the future of democracy in the country, the former foreign minister said that there needs to be a new social pact, and the relaunching of a process of democratic change based on the new reality.
""The global political scenario is changing. The axis of the new political order must be a democracy that characterizes and stimulates the needs of the people,"" he said.
If changes are not made, he said, the United States is destined for failure, fragmentation, and the deepening of democratic decadence.
He stressed that a new political model is necessary to provide answers to the needs of the people through consensus and dialogue.

""Governments will consider all of these factors when making decisions about epidemic prevention policies and base their decisions on the best available scientific evidence and expert advice,"" the health scientist added.

U.S. House elects new speaker after historic deadlock,"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer responded to the alleged concessions after McCarthy's election, saying the proposals ""will cause a government shutdown or a default with devastating consequences to our country.""
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of Representatives elected Congressman Kevin McCarthy as speaker early Saturday morning after a historic deadlock that kept the lower chamber from being fully functional days after the new Congress convened.
McCarthy, a California Republican, clinched enough votes to become House speaker in the 15th round of voting -- the longest contest in 164 years -- after a bitter fight with a group of hardline conservatives and 14 failed ballots.
It was the first time a House speaker -- who maintains order, manages its proceedings, and governs the administration of its business on the lower chamber's floor -- had not been elected on the first ballot in 100 years.
U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, said earlier this week that it is ""embarrassing for the country"" not to have a fully functional Congress, the legislature of the federal government.

All House Democrats voted for Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, making him the minority leader and the first African American lawmaker to run a party in either chamber of the U.S. Congress.
To flip Republican holdouts, McCarthy reportedly made a series of concessions, including a lower threshold to force a vote on ousting the House speaker and a floor vote on a border security bill. He also promised that efforts to raise the nation's debt ceiling must be paired with spending cuts.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, also a New York Democrat, responded to the alleged concessions after McCarthy's election, saying the proposals ""will cause a government shutdown or a default with devastating consequences to our country.""
""Speaker Kevin McCarthy's dream job could turn into a nightmare for the American people,"" Schumer said. ""To get the votes, he surrendered to demands of a fringe element of the Republican party.""

Two years ago, a large group of supporters of outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump violently stormed the Capitol and disrupted a joint session of Congress to affirm the results of the 2020 presidential election in which Biden won.
Some of the rioters chanted ""Hang Mike Pence"" while making their way into the Capitol. Pence, then U.S. vice president presiding over the procedure to formally verify Biden's victory, was rushed out of the building by Secret Service agents to a secure location.

Panicked lawmakers took shelter and crouched behind chairs in the House gallery after the chaos broke out and shocked the United States and the rest of the world.
Approximately 140 police officers were assaulted in the worst attack on the U.S. Capitol in more than 200 years, to which at least five deaths have been linked. Over 900 individuals have been arrested in nearly all 50 states for crimes related to the breach of the landmark complex.
At a ceremony in the White House on Friday, Biden warned that things like the Capitol riot ""could happen again"" as the United States faces ""an inflection point"" in its history.
Two years after the riot, U.S. democracy ""is in distress and the House is a total mess,"" said Brad Bannon, a Democratic pollster and CEO of Bannon Communications Research. ""The impasse in the U.S. House of Representatives over the election of the Speaker is another demonstration of the decline in our political institutions.""

U.S. House elects new speaker after historic deadlock,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of Representatives elected Congressman Kevin McCarthy as speaker early Saturday morning after a historic deadlock that kept the lower chamber from being fully functional days after the new Congress convened.
McCarthy, a California Republican, clinched enough votes to become House speaker in the 15th round of voting -- the longest contest in 164 years -- after a bitter fight with a group of hardline conservatives and 14 failed ballots.
It was the first time a House speaker -- who maintains order, manages its proceedings, and governs the administration of its business on the lower chamber's floor -- had not been elected on the first ballot in 100 years.
All House Democrats voted for Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, making him the minority leader and the first African American lawmaker to run a party in either chamber of the U.S. Congress.

Thailand to benefit from China's optimized COVID-19 strategy: expert,"BANGKOK, Jan. 7 (Xinhua) -- China's optimized COVID-19 strategy will help boost Thailand's economic recovery amid a gloomy global economic outlook, a Thai expert said.
The return of Chinese tourists will bolster the tourism industry and related businesses such as accommodation, transportation, food and beverage, and retail, Kevalin Wangpichayasuk, assistant managing director of Kasikorn Research Center, said in a recent written interview with Xinhua.
It was estimated that in the pre-COVID-19 era, the consumption of Chinese tourists accounted for more than 3 percent of Thailand's nominal GDP, she added.
The Thai government expects about 300,000 Chinese tourists to visit Thailand in the first three months of this year. It also sets a target of approximately 5 million Chinese tourists in 2023, equivalent to 45 percent of Chinese arrivals in 2019.
Kevalin noted that she does not expect a major return of Chinese tourists until the second half of this year, or as soon as the second quarter of this year, due to visa processing time and gradual resumption of international flights, among others.
In addition to tourism, increased economic activities with China are bound to promote trade and investment between the two countries, she said.
""We expect that Thai exports to China in 2023 would be better than other export markets and outperform the growth projection of total exports,"" she added.

U.S. Los Angeles County declares state of emergency over homeless crisis,"LOS ANGELES, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- Los Angeles County in the United States approved a motion on Tuesday to declare a state of emergency over the region's homeless crisis.
Homelessness is a specific and prolonged emergency that is impacting more individuals than other emergencies, said the motion co-authored by L.A. County supervisors Lindsey Horvath and Kathryn Barger.
""Homelessness is a complicated and multifaceted issue that requires, among other things, the development of new affordable housing, including land-use policy decisions to permit such housing,"" said the motion.
The motion called for the L.A. County to provide critical services to unhoused individuals, including general health, mental health, and substance abuse treatment services.
As of early 2022, Los Angeles County had 69,144 unhoused residents, including 70 percent that were unsheltered, the highest number of unsheltered persons in the country, according to the motion.
The declaration of a state of emergency over the region's homeless crisis will expedite supportive and material services for people who are unhoused, according to county officials.

Nurse shortage betrays fractured U.S. medical system,"

NEW YORK, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of nurses and their supporters lined both sides of Madison Avenue in front of Mount Sinai Hospital on Monday, waving signs, blowing horns and calling for a labor contract that will require more nurses at the bedside for patients.
The nurses, members of the New York State Nurses Association, went on strike after talks with Mount Sinai Hospital management broke down in the early morning hours. Strikes also unfolded at the three campuses of the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx over similar issues of pay and staffing.
""Monday's labor action, involving more than 7,000 nurses, represented the largest nursing strike in decades in New York City,"" said The New York Times (NYT), noting that nurses are increasingly turning toward walkouts as a labor strategy, both nationally and abroad.
""Nurses, who both saw how valued they were during the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic, and who struggled with exhaustion and burnout, said they were standing their ground to improve conditions both for themselves and their patients,"" it added.

GREED AND GAP
In an opinion article published one year earlier by NYT, ""We Know the Real Cause of the Crisis in Our Hospitals. It's Greed,"" the author said that as the third year of COVID-19 started, America's nurses -- who people celebrated as heroes during the early days of lockdown -- were now leaving the bedside.
""Nurses set the record straight about the root cause of the nursing crisis: chronic understaffing by profit-driven hospitals that predates the pandemic,"" it said, quoting one nurse as saying that ""I could no longer work in critical care under the conditions I was being forced to work under with poor staffing.""
""Fueled by factors like employee burnout, an aging population and a dearth of training, states across the country are facing a familiar and common problem: a nursing shortage,"" U.S. News and World Report once noted, saying that even before the COVID-19 pandemic began to unfold at the start of 2020, a gap existed between the supply and the demand through 2030.
Once the COVID-19 crisis hit, health care positions were not isolated from sudden job losses, which helped widen the gap between projected demand and the actual number of registered nurses in the United States, it added.
SHORTAGE AND DECLINE
A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) study projected that the demand for registered nurses would hit more than 3.6 million by year 2030. On top of the existing workforce, the field would have needed to add nearly 50,000 new registered nurses each year since 2014 to meet that demand.
""The shortage may worsen in part due to who exactly is leaving the profession,"" said U.S. News and World Report. Since 2016, registered nurses 25 to 34 years old have accounted for the highest share of the profession by age group. But between May 2020 and May 2021, the number of nurses in that age group declined 5.2 percent.
Meanwhile, those 35 to 44 years old, who make up the second highest share of nurses, saw their numbers decline at an even higher rate of 7.4 percent. The number of registered nurses 65 and older hit its highest level yet in data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that dates back to 2011.
Pandemic job losses in health care as a whole impacted women much more than men. In January 2020, women held over 13 million jobs in the U.S. health care industry, compared with the 3 million held by men. By April of that year, women had lost 10.6 percent, or 1.38 million, of those positions, as men lost 5.5 percent of theirs.

ANXIETY AND EXODUS
Amid the pandemic, ""health leaders say nurses are bone-tired and frustrated from being asked to work overtime, from getting screamed at and second-guessed by members of the community, and from dealing with people who chose not to get vaccinated or wear a mask,"" NBC has reported.
As Omicron cases surged, U.S. nurses had been stretched to their limits for months under extreme physical and emotional burden and facing immense burnout.
""Many nurses are left to silently suffer as they face overwhelming feelings of exhaustion, irritability, anxiety and sadness that are chipping away daily at our mental health,"" said Lauren Ghazal, a board-certified family nurse practitioner in New York and a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Michigan.
As the American workforce was then undergoing a rapid transformation as part of the ""Great Resignation,"" more nurses turned toward options like travel nursing -- short-term employment contracts in hospitals and regions that were in dire need of them and offered more money than the salary of local staff nurses, the report said.
RATIOS AND SAFETY
To keep patients safe and protect health care workers, lawmakers came up with an idea of nurse-patient ratios regulation, which California put in place in 2004, with positive results. Similar legislation was proposed and defeated in Massachusetts several years ago with help from a 25-million-U.S. dollar ""no"" campaign funded by the hospital lobby.
However, such a plan is currently on the table in Illinois and Pennsylvania. These laws could save patients' lives and create a more just work environment for a vulnerable generation of nurses, the ones the country pledged to honor and protect at the start of the pandemic.
U.S. National Nurses United has been an active advocate of the nurse-patient ratios regulation, saying that ""safe staffing ratios, coupled with nurses' powerful voice of advocacy secured in collective bargaining, protect our patients from complications that arise from missed care such as medical errors, health care disparities, infections, and so much more.""
""Decades of studies have shown that more nurses equate to lives saved and fewer complications. Researchers have been focusing on what exactly is the mediating link between increasing RN (registered nurse) staffing and improved outcomes,"" it added.

Ukraine's foodstuff exports reach 17 mln tons under grain deal,"KIEV, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's foodstuff exports reached 17 million metric tons since August under a deal on the export of grain and fertilizers from Black Sea ports, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reported Tuesday.
In the past three days, five vessels loaded with 158,500 metric tons of agricultural products departed from Ukraine's ports for Egypt, Sri Lanka and other countries, the agency said, citing the Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority.
Currently, 98 ships are waiting for inspection in the Bosphorus, with 21 of them already loaded and 77 heading for loading.
On July 22, Russia and Ukraine separately signed a document in Istanbul with TÃ¼rkiye and the United Nations on grain and fertilizer exports from Ukraine and Russia to ensure supplies to global markets amid the Russia-Ukraine armed conflict.

1 child or youth died every 4.4 seconds in 2021: UN report,"

UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 5 million children died before their fifth birthday and another 2.1 million children and youth aged between 5 and 24 years lost their lives in 2021, according to the latest estimates released by the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation on Tuesday.
In a separate report also released on Tuesday, the group found that 1.9 million babies were stillborn during the same period.
""Every day, far too many parents are facing the trauma of losing their children, sometimes even before their first breath,"" said Vidhya Ganesh, UN Children's Fund director of the Division of Data Analytics, Planning and Monitoring, in a press release. ""Such widespread, preventable tragedy should never be accepted as inevitable. Progress is possible with stronger political will and targeted investment in equitable access to primary health care for every woman and child.""
The reports show some positive outcomes with a lower risk of death across all ages globally since 2000. The global under-5 mortality rate fell by half since the start of the century, while mortality rates in older children and youth dropped by 36 percent, and the stillbirth rate decreased by 35 percent. This can be attributed to more investments in strengthening primary health systems to benefit women, children and young people.
However, gains have reduced significantly since 2010, and 54 countries will fall short of meeting the Sustainable Development Goals target for under-5 mortality. Unless swift action is taken to improve health services, almost 59 million children and youth will die before 2030, and nearly 16 million babies will be lost to stillbirth, warn the agencies.
Children continue to face wildly differentiating chances of survival based on where they are born, with sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia shouldering the heaviest burden, the reports show.
Though sub-Saharan Africa had just 29 percent of global live births, the region accounted for 56 percent of all under-5 deaths in 2021, and Southern Asia for 26 percent of the total. Children born in sub-Saharan Africa are subject to the highest risk of childhood death in the world -- 15 times higher than the risk for children in Europe and Northern America.
Mothers in these two regions also endure the painful loss of babies to stillbirth at an exceptional rate, with 77 percent of all stillbirths in 2021 occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Nearly half of all stillbirths happened in sub-Saharan Africa. The risk of a woman having a stillborn baby in sub-Saharan Africa is seven times more likely than in Europe and North America, the reports show.
Access to and availability of quality health care continues to be a matter of life or death for children globally. Most child deaths occur in the first five years, of which half are within the very first month of life. For those youngest babies, premature birth and complications during labor are the leading causes of death. Similarly, more than 40 percent of stillbirths occur during labor, most of which are preventable when women have access to quality care throughout pregnancy and birth. For children that survive past their first 28 days, infectious diseases like pneumonia, diarrhea and malaria pose the biggest threat, according to the reports.
While COVID-19 has not directly increased childhood mortality, with children facing a lower likelihood of dying from the disease than adults, the pandemic may have increased future risks to their survival. In particular, the reports highlight concerns around disruptions to vaccination campaigns, nutrition services, and access to primary health care, which could jeopardize their health and well-being for many years to come. In addition, the pandemic has fuelled the largest continued backslide in vaccinations in three decades, putting the most vulnerable newborns and children at greater risk of dying from preventable diseases.

UK gov't introduces laws to mitigate disruption of strikes on public,"LONDON, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom (UK) government on Tuesday introduced new laws that would enable it to set minimum levels of service during strikes to ensure the safety of the public and their access to public services.
In a bid to mitigate the disruptions caused by strikes, the bill would ensure that crucial public services, such as rail, ambulances and fire services, maintain a minimum service during industrial action, ""reducing risk to life and ensuring the public can still get to work,"" a government statement said.
""The first job of any government is to keep the public safe. Because whilst we absolutely believe in the ability to strike, we are duty-bound to protect the lives and livelihoods of the British people,"" Business Secretary Grant Shapps said in the statement.
The UK has been in the grip of a wave of strikes, which started in summer 2022 and continued into this year, as inflation has stayed consistently high and pay rises failed to keep up. Rail workers and nurses were among those who staged the action.
The government locked horns with the trade unions. It said the pay rises that unions had called for were unaffordable and higher pay would not help fight inflation. On Monday, government ministers and unions met, but the talks once again failed to change course.
The unions criticized the new legislation on Tuesday. This bill was ""another dangerous gimmick"" from a government that should be negotiating to resolve the current crisis, said General Secretary Sharon Graham of Unite, one of the largest trade unions in the UK.
""Evidence from abroad clearly shows this kind of legislation only forces unions to use other tactics, inflaming and prolonging disputes,"" Graham added.

Feature: Avian flu hits U.S. West from wilderness to grocery,"

DENVER, the United States, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- Egg shortages and skyrocketing prices at grocery stores continue to impact American consumers as a result of the historic avian flu that is spreading rapidly among wild birds and has triggered the killing of millions of poultry.
""We have never seen anything like the enormity of this outbreak,"" Michael Tincher with the Rocky Mountain Raptor Program (RMRP) told The Colorado Sun newspaper on Monday. RMRP is a group of a dozen scientists who work toward protecting and saving wild birds of prey.
Colorado's worst-ever avian flu outbreak has now resulted in nearly 6.4 million poultry deaths and is increasingly crossing over into wild birds and killing bald eagles and other precious raptors, the newspaper reported, adding ""wildlife watchers call the event 'the stuff of bad dreams.'""
Last week, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) defined on its website the recent bird flu as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) and warned poultry producers that ""wild birds can be infected and show no signs of illness. They can carry the disease to new areas when migrating, potentially exposing domestic poultry to the virus.""
HPAI has been detected in all 50 U.S. states, with Colorado, Utah, North Dakota, Oregon and California in the top 10 states having confirmed deaths of wild birds, although Florida, with its abundant coastline and waterfowl, leads the country in bird deaths with 379, according to USDA data.
Hundreds of wild bird deaths may not sound like many, but experts said the numbers being reported are ""just a small fraction"" of birds dying in the wild.
""Wildlife officials say they are overwhelmed by reports of carcasses in the wild and have limited testing of dead birds in order to concentrate efforts in the most impacted areas,"" the newspaper said.
Calling the current global avian outbreak ""the Covid of Bird Flus,"" Tincher told Xinhua that initial keys toward combating the plague are education and awareness, and ""not about creating a panic.""
""When Covid hit, we didn't know anything about it, so we need to be patient,"" he said. ""We need to play the long game and see how it carries out.""
Wild birds affected by the virus cover the gamut of wild water fowl from the White Pelican in the south to the Snow Goose in the North, and include the Red-Tailed Hawk, the Mallard, and the Bald Eagle, the legendary symbol of America's heritage.
Last month, Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) officials were dismayed that the current blight had killed a tagged and tracked Bald Eagle, one of the state's ""resurgent but still tenuous population of nesting bald eagles totaling 250 to 300 pairs statewide,"" CBS Colorado reported.
""It's definitely somewhat demoralizing, especially to be losing these numbers of birds and in so many locations,"" CPW researcher Reesa Conrey told the media.
Meanwhile, local markets across the West are suffering from the bird flu pandemic.
""The mass slaughter of egg-laying flocks has decimated the commercial egg market in the state,"" The Colorado Sun added, adding every major egg producer in Colorado has been hit hard since the outbreak escalated again last month.
""Consumers don't realize that this hike in egg prices is not due to inflation, but due to worst avian flu outbreak on record,"" Tincher said, noting that the ""Highly Pathogenic"" classification of the illness sets it aside from all others, ever.
Egg prices doubled in 2022, according to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and thus far 2023, consumers are facing more egg hikes.
""Ten Dollars for a dozen eggs, that's absolutely ridiculous,"" Erma Rouse, a Circle K employee in North Denver, told Xinhua on Tuesday, whose small convenience store had no eggs for sale on that day.
Rouse was aware that the avian outbreak has caused egg shortages and price jumps, telling Xinhua that she ""won't eat them again until the price drops.""
""We get calls from people who tell us a nearby raptor or eagle is acting funny or dying, and the first question we ask them is if they have any poultry nearby,"" Tincher told Xinhua.
Many poultry farmers who live in rural areas are not fully aware that the ongoing avian outbreak, which has been ebbing and increasing in severity for almost a year, is possibly being spread more by wild birds carrying the disease.
Not only Colorado's major producers have to destroy flocks of egg-laying chickens, thousands of small chicken operators and citizens who eat their own eggs or sell them in small quantities are also feeling the pinch.
Last March, a commercial flock of 2.75 million chickens in Wisconsin ""had to be culled,"" Reuters reported, and in April, ""U.S. egg factory roasts 5.3 million chickens in avian flu cull,"" The Guardian's headline read.

Elephants kill 53-year-old man in southwestern Uganda,"KAMPALA, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- Stray elephants killed a 53-year-old man in the southwestern district of Kanungu as he guarded his crops against wild animals from the Queen Elizabeth National Park in Uganda.
Ahimbisibwe Rugaju, Kanungu Deputy Resident District Commissioner, in a statement on Monday said two elephants strayed out of the park on Sunday and destroyed acres of gardens before the residents started chasing them back into the park.
""However, as the elephants moved towards the park, they came across the deceased while he was guarding his potato garden near his homestead where he was killed instantly,"" Rugaju said.
According to Rugaju, the residents have been complaining about stray animals destroying their crops despite the government promising to put a fence around the park.
""The residents have since threatened to kill wild animals when they are sighted in their gardens since the Uganda Wildlife Authority rangers have failed in their duty to drive the animals back to the park whenever they attack,"" Rugaju added.
He however urged the residents against harming wildlife and to always work with park authorities to ensure that the animals are returned to the park.

"Man in custody over shootings at New Mexico Democratic officials' homes, offices","HOUSTON, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- A man is in custody due to possible links with at least one shooting at the homes or offices of Democratic elected officials in Albuquerque, the largest city in the southwestern U.S. state New Mexico, authorities said Monday.
The unidentified suspect, who is said to be under 50, has not been formally charged in any of the cases, the Albuquerque Police Department (APD) said.
The APD has recovered a firearm that was linked to one of the shootings, APD Chief Harold Medina said at a brief news conference.
""We are trying to still link and see which cases are related and which are not related,"" said Medina. ""So until we get more details and we finish the process of seeing where the evidence leads up and getting returns on our warrants, this will be the extent of our information.""
Earlier on Monday, the APD reported that investigators are looking into a sixth shooting which happened in early December at the home of incoming New Mexico House Speaker, Democratic Representative Javier Martinez.
Including Martinez, six Democratic elected officials' homes or offices were shot at in December 2022 and January 2023.
It remains unclear if the shootings are all connected, though police say they've found ""potential connections between some of the shootings.""
However, Medina said it was ""too early"" to talk about motives behind the shootings, which were all directed towards homes or offices of Democratic officials.
During the shootings, multiple rounds have been fired into the doors and walls of the officials' homes or offices, in some cases while the officials were inside with their families. No one has been hurt.
According to the APD, the first shooting occurred on Dec. 4, 2022, at the home of Bernalillo County Commissioner Adriann Barboa. Someone shot eight rounds at his house.
On Dec. 10, ShotSpotter technology detected several gunshots in the area of New Mexico Attorney General Raul Torrez's former campaign office, where the attorney general had already moved out following his November election.
One day later, the home of then Bernalillo Commissioner Debbie O'Malley came under fire. More than a dozen gunshot impacts were identified on walls and the house.
Last week, state Senator Linda Lopez's home was hit by at least eight shots after midnight, and the police department's ShotSpotter system registered three shots fired at a downtown law office where state Senator Moe Maestas works.
The shootings occurred nearly two years after a large group of supporters of then U.S. President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021, and disrupted a joint session of Congress to affirm the 2020 presidential election results.

Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Ishtaye urged the U.S. government to ""exert real pressure"" on Israel to stop all violations and release the Palestinian tax revenue dues it had illegally deducted.
RAMALLAH, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Ishtaye on Thursday called on the U.S. government to stop all violations and unilateral measures adopted by Israel against the Palestinians.
An official statement said Ishtaye made the remarks during a meeting with Hady Amr, the U.S. special representative for Palestinian affairs in the State Department's Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs.
The two sides discussed the unilateral practices taken by the new Israeli government, headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, against the Palestinian people as soon as it assumed power.

""The U.S. government is required to move urgently to put an end to the unilateral Israeli measures and threats that undermine the national authority and systematically end the possibility of establishing a Palestinian state,"" Ishtaye told Amr.
He pointed to a need for the upcoming visit of U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan to the region to carry a message of hope for the Palestinian people.
""The two U.S. officials should deliver a clear statement to the Israeli government that it is obligated to respect international law and the agreements Israel signed with the Palestinians,"" Ishtaye said.

He urged the United States ""to exert real pressure on the Israeli government to stop all violations and release the Palestinian tax revenue dues it had illegally deducted.""
Ishtaye said the Palestinian people and their leadership ""will not accept the fait accompli and will move forward in the popular, political, diplomatic and legal struggle in the face of the Israeli measures.""
On Friday, the Israeli cabinet for security and political affairs approved punitive measures against the Palestinian Authority for its approach to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.

""First and foremost, I urge all member states to uphold the vision and the values of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and to abide by international law,"" the UN chief said.
UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday called on all member states to uphold the vision and the values of the UN Charter and the rule of law in particular.
""First and foremost, I urge all member states to uphold the vision and the values of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and to abide by international law,"" the UN chief told a Security Council meeting on the promotion and strengthening of the rule of law in the maintenance of international peace and security.
Noting that the rule of law is ""foundational to the United Nations, and to our mission of peace,"" and that the cornerstone of the rule of law is that ""all people, institutions, and entities, public and private, including the state itself, are accountable before the law,"" the top UN official said the rule of law protects the vulnerable, and prevents discrimination, harassment and other abuses.
""It is our first line of defense against atrocity crimes, including genocide. It creates and bolsters trust in institutions. It supports fair, inclusive economies and societies. And it is the basis of international cooperation and multilateralism,"" he said.
The debate on this topic at the Security Council, said Guterres, ""sends a strong message that ensuring the rule of law is our priority, and that all countries must adhere to international standards.""
""We are at grave risk of the Rule of Lawlessness,"" he warned.

The rule of law is foundational to efforts by the United Nations to find peaceful solutions to all these conflicts, disasters and crises and more, and to support the most vulnerable people and communities around the world, said the UN chief.
""I count on member states to support our efforts to promote the rule of law across the board, including on this council,"" he added.
While the challenges are many, the primacy of the rule of law is essential to the maintenance of international peace and security and for peacebuilding efforts, he said. ""I urge member states to make full use of the rule of law as a preventive tool.""
He also urged the international community to reinforce the rule of law as a key enabler to achieve the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, noting that ""Goal 16 on access to justice for all and effective, inclusive and accountable institutions is a critical enabler for the other SDGs.""
Turning to his report on Our Common Agenda, Guterres said it calls for a new vision for the rule of law ""that is an opportunity to reset and reinforce the centrality of the rule of law in all activities of our organization.""
The rule of law is key to addressing existing and future challenges, from nuclear disarmament to the climate crisis, the collapse of biodiversity, pandemics and dangerous diseases, he stressed, adding that the United Nations is uniquely positioned to lead in promoting innovation and progress in accordance with the rule of law.
""There is no other global organization with our legitimacy, convening power and normative impact,"" he said.

ANKARA, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- TÃ¼rkiye has ushered in the new year with significant pay hikes for minimum-wage earners, pensioners, and civil servants amid a cost-of-living crisis that has plunged millions into financial hardship.
Inflation remains alarmingly high despite a sharp drop to 64.2 percent in December, the Turkish Statistical Institute announced on Jan. 3, down from 84.3 percent reported in November after hitting a 24-year high in October.
Annual food prices rose by 77.9 percent in December, down from 102.6 percent in November, while energy prices increased 118 percent, down from 94.4 percent compared to the previous month.
The government announced a 55-percent increase in the official minimum wage for 2023 to a monthly 8,500 Turkish liras (453 U.S. dollars), raised salaries for civil servants, and hiked pensions by 30 percent to ease households' pressure stemming from runaway inflation.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also announced a measure that would allow over 2 million people to potentially retire immediately, but the spending spree as a result of the measure is expected to swell the budget, according to experts.
The government has as well launched a long-awaited income housing loan campaign for mid-income citizens and relief measures for businesses.
Erdogan, who faces tight presidential and parliamentary elections in June, had promised a serious drop in the inflation rate in the new year.
""We expect similar base-driven effects to continue for a few more months, bringing inflation down to 40 percent in the period leading up to the election,"" Enver Erkan, chief economist at Istanbul's Tera Securities, said in a note to investors.
""Despite this, we still need to talk about a public expenditure increase that can feed periodic price increases before the election,"" the expert warned.
Most opinion polls show the president and his ruling Justice and Development Party, who are in power for more than two decades, have lost some support in recent years, as the currency depreciated and living costs rose.
While wages have been increased for millions, price hikes continued on a wide range of services and goods in January.
Following a price increase of 29 percent in mass transport fees in Istanbul, TÃ¼rkiye's largest city, the capital city Ankara has followed suit with around 35 percent rise for commuters, the municipalities announced.
Alcohol and cigarette prices saw an increase of 22.2 percent while the prices of most essential food products such as bread, eggs, meat, and dairy have hiked between 30 and 50 percent, according to the local press.

In Ankara's residential Cankaya district, citizens have expressed frustration with the government's wage hikes.
""The wage hikes are insufficient and have already been eroded"" by soaring food prices, Adem Cam, a 70-year-old pensioner, told Xinhua.
The man who still works in the real estate sector said it is impossible to get by with a minimum wage in a family of four, calling on the government to work on measures that would refrain retailers from hiking their prices.
""They may have hiked wages by 30 to 40 percent, but food prices are going up unabated ... Therefore the salary increases don't mean anything because the price of essential goods has gone up,"" he said.
""In the past, we could go somewhere to eat or drink with my spouse and my children, but now this has become impossible,"" Cam lamented his falling purchasing power.
According to a report released in December of 2022 by the Confederation of Turkish Trade Unions, the poverty threshold increased to 26,481 liras, which is over three times the recently hiked minimum wage.
Most Turkish households are not feeling the marked decline in the inflation rate and are still struggling to make ends meet.

""I don't feel a drop in inflation. For me, the inflation rate is around 300 percent,"" said Nihat Basaran, a 52-year-old retired army personnel.
""There is a big difference in price in the items that you buy yesterday compared to today. Yesterday was better than today, and today will be better than tomorrow,"" he added.

According to temperature data gathered by WMO, 2022 was the eighth consecutive year when annual global temperatures reached at least one degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
GENEVA, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- Soaring greenhouse gas levels and accumulated heat have led to the warmest eight years on record, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Thursday.
According to temperature data gathered by WMO, 2022 was the eighth consecutive year when annual global temperatures reached at least one degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
The landmark 2015 Paris Agreement pledged to keep global warming ""well below"" two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and to strive for a lower limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius.
Meanwhile, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has underlined that global warming should be limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius or below.

However, the latest WMO data has shown that the average global temperature in 2022 was around 1.15 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, while the ten-year average temperature for the period 2013-2022 was 1.14 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial baseline.
This indicates that long-term warming continues, and the likelihood of temporarily breaching the 1.5 degrees Celsius target is increasing, said WMO.
Global warming and other long-term climate change trends are expected to continue, WMO said, due to record levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
Extreme heatwaves, drought and devastating flooding affected millions and cost billions in 2022, according to WMO's provisional State of the Global Climate in 2022 report.

New US border measures could undermine fundamental human rights: UN rights chief,"GENEVA, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- New border enforcement measures announced by the U.S. could undermine the foundations of international human rights and refugee law, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said Wednesday.
""These measures appear to be at variance with the prohibition of collective expulsion and the principle of non-refoulement,"" the UN Human Rights Chief said.
The measures include the increased use of expedited removals, and expansion of the use of the Title 42 public health order allowing for the fast-track expulsion to Mexico of some 30,000 Venezuelans, Haitians, Cubans and Nicaraguans each month.
According to the UN figures, Title 42 has already been used by US immigration officials some 2.5 million times at the southern border, to expel people to Mexico or their home country without an individualized assessment of all their protection needs, due process and procedural safeguards.
The High Commissioner also expressed concern that those most in need of asylum and those in vulnerable situations are unlikely to meet the requirements to be granted humanitarian parole, including having a financial sponsor in the USA.
""We hear a great deal of talk about migration crises, but in reality, it is those migrating who often are the ones truly in crisis. Rather than vilifying them and stripping them of long-recognized rights, we should be seeking to govern migration humanely and safely with full respect for the human rights of every individual,"" he stressed.

Compulsory COVID testing for travelers from China unnecessary: Swiss authority,"GENEVA, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- The current COVID-19 epidemiological situation ""does not presently warrant compulsory testing for travelers from China,"" according to Swiss health authority.
The Omicron variants presently circulating in China pose only a small risk to Switzerland, it has said.
The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) said in a statement that the Swiss Federal Council had discussed the latest European Union (EU) recommendations, which would require passengers flying from China to the EU to have a negative COVID-19 test before boarding.
The Swiss authority has, however, decided that ""travelers from China should not be required to undergo compulsory COVID-19 testing at the present time.""
""People in Switzerland currently have strong protection against developing severe COVID-19: many of them have already been vaccinated or have already been infected and recovered,"" it said.

The FOPH also said that the Omicron variants currently circulating in China ""are already extensively distributed in Switzerland or are already on the decline.""
The circulation of the virus in Switzerland is currently so high that ""compulsorily testing the relatively small number of persons arriving in the country from China directly by air would have minimal impact on the virus's current spread,"" it noted.
""The risk of new virus variants of concern developing is also no higher in China than elsewhere,"" it added.

"China's reopening to inject new impetus into Cambodian, world tourism growth","PHNOM PENH, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Tourism Minister Thong Khon said on Wednesday that China's optimization of its pandemic control policies will give new momentum to tourism growth in Cambodia and the rest of the world.
""On behalf of the government and the Ministry of Tourism, I would like to welcome the return of Chinese tourists to Cambodia,"" he told Xinhua.
""As we all know, China was the most important outbound tourism market for the world, so China's resumption of outbound tourism is very beneficial not only to Cambodia, but also to the whole world,"" he said.
Khon said the Southeast Asian nation is ready to welcome Chinese people, tourists and investors, saying they have significantly contributed to the kingdom's socio-economic development and poverty reduction.
""After China's reopening on January 8, we hope that Cambodia will attract at least one million Chinese tourists in 2023,"" he said, noting that Cambodia received only 110,000 Chinese tourists in 2022.
As the Chinese Spring Festival draws near, the minister expressed his hope that more Chinese tourists will spend their holidays in Cambodia on the occasion.
Cambodia received 2.36 million Chinese tourists in the pre-COVID-19 pandemic era in 2019, generating about 1.8 billion U.S. dollars in revenue, according to the Ministry of Tourism.
Khon said the number of Chinese tourists to Cambodia is expected to reach the pre-pandemic level in 2024.
Thourn Sinan, chairman of the Pacific Asia Travel Association Cambodia chapter, agreed that China's resumption of outbound tourism would drive global tourism growth including Cambodia in the post-pandemic era.
""It's not only Cambodia, but also the world is waiting for the return of the Chinese tourists to their countries,"" he told Xinhua.
Sinan said China is one of the main sources of tourists to Cambodia, pointing out that the presence of Chinese tourists has greatly contributed to the development of tourism in the kingdom.
""We are ready to welcome and we are quite busy these few weeks to redesign package tours and to redesign services for Chinese tourists, so it is very good news for all of us,"" he said.
Sinan said Cambodia is a popular destination for both Chinese holiday makers and investors, given the historical and close relationship between the two countries.
Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen said in a public speech earlier this month that the presence of Chinese tourists is vital to the country's tourism and economic growth and that the country will not follow some other nations in imposing COVID-19 related restrictions on Chinese tourists' arrivals.
Tourism is one of the four major pillars supporting Cambodia's economy. In the pre-pandemic era, the country registered 6.6 million international tourists in 2019, generating 4.92 billion U.S. dollars in revenue that contributed 12.1 percent to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
Cambodia is famous for its three world heritage sites, namely the Angkor Archaeological Park in Siem Reap province, the Preah Vihear Temple in Preah Vihear province, and the Sambor Prei Kuk Archaeological Site in Kampong Thom province.
Besides, it has a 450-km pristine coastline stretching across four southwestern provinces.

Biden aides find second batch of classified documents at different location: media,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- A second batch of classified documents belonging to U.S. President Joe Biden was reportedly discovered by his aides at a new location, according to multiple U.S. media outlets on Wednesday.
The news emerged two days after White House special counsel Richard Sauber released a statement, saying that ""a small number of documents with classified markings"" were found at one of Biden's former private offices in Washington, D.C.
The new batch was reported to have been found at a separate location from the initial one inside the Penn Biden Center, a think tank affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania and named for Biden.
Sauber said Biden, a Democrat who served as U.S. vice president from January 2009 to January 2017, periodically used this space from mid-2017 until the start of his 2020 presidential campaign.
Since the discovery of the first group of classified documents on Nov. 2, 2022, White House aides have been looking for any additional classified documents in other locations, according to NBC News.
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refused to say on Wednesday why the Biden administration did not inform the public sooner. The discovery was made six days ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.
Jean-Pierre told reporters at the White House briefing that the situation was under review by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and that she would not comment on it further.
Biden said on Tuesday he was ""surprised to learn there were any government records that were taken there to that office"" while in Mexico City, where he had a trilateral summit with the leaders of Mexico and Canada.
He added he did not know ""what's in the documents"" that were found in a locked closet when his attorneys were vacating office space at the Penn Biden Center.
The classified documents inside the Penn Biden Center closet are reportedly U.S. intelligence memos and briefing materials covering topics including Ukraine, Iran and Britain.
U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland is said to have tasked the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, John Lausch Jr., with reviewing the matter.
U.S. Congressman James Comer, a Republican who chairs the House Oversight Committee, has said that he plans to press the National Archives, which his committee oversees, for information about the classified documents.
The DOJ is also investigating former President Donald Trump's handling of a trove of classified documents seized from his estate in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, by federal agents in the summer of 2022.
The Presidential Records Act requires all presidential and vice-presidential documents to be turned over to the National Archives.

In his keynote speech, Ban said geopolitical tensions, climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic, among other crises, profoundly peril humanity and the earth, stressing the need for global solutions.
The UN SDGs, with the vision of ""no one is left behind,"" offer a collaborative blueprint and have made tangible progress in addressing critical global issues such as hunger and poverty, Ban said, adding that he was confident that attaining the SDGs will bring the world together and help ""rebuild society better, greener and more resilient.""
In particular, the former UN chief highlighted the need for multilateral cooperation in tackling climate change, calling on all countries to take responsibility for expediting decarbonization.
Ban spoke highly of China's active action in climate change mitigation and adaptation, and appreciated China's strong commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.
He urged all stakeholders to ""strengthen cooperation, innovation, engagement and action"" while forging new partnerships, leveling the digital playing field, promoting science and technology, and enhancing education, transparency and accountability.
Financial leaders also have a crucial role to play in the financial support for global adaptation of climate change, he added.
""We must remember that the challenges we are currently facing are simply too enormous to be left in the hands of a few leaders. All of us have to work together in solidarity,"" he said.
The forum includes more than 40 discussion sessions, featuring financial, government and business leaders to shed light on major topics, including global economic outlook and regional trade collaborations.

ISTANBUL, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- TÃ¼rkiye's cultural and financial heart, Istanbul, the only city in the world spanning Europe and Asia, is preparing for the arrival of Chinese tourists.
Soon after China downgraded its COVID-19 measures on Jan. 8, easing international travel, tourism representatives in the city started discussing ways to attract more Chinese travelers with a wide range of promotional activities.
""The opening of the Chinese market is essential to us,"" Murat Arslan, general manager of CVK Park Bosphorus Hotel, told Xinhua in an interview. ""We know Chinese people travel a lot in Istanbul. Rather than sea, sand, and sun, they have a more cultural and gastronomic experience-oriented travel understanding,"" Arslan noted.
According to Arslan, Istanbul offers a lot for Chinese tourists, including boat tours on the Bosphorus Strait flowing between the European and Asian sides; the historical peninsula of Sultanahmet; ancient palaces, churches and mosques; and a vivid nightlife with numerous restaurants and bars.
The hotel manager said travel representatives have sped up efforts to offer a unique experience to Chinese visitors to the city.
Meanwhile, Arslan's teams are updating the hotel's menus to introduce a wide range of Turkish delicacies.

""We are also considering a trip to China soon. Again, we continue to work nonstop on Turkish tourism to get a larger share of the cake from China's market,"" he said.
Ali Can Aksu, head of the Turkish Hotel Managers Association, told Xinhua that Chinese travelers are significant for global tourism.
""The entire world measures the needs of Chinese tourists and acts accordingly. It is also followed very closely by TÃ¼rkiye,"" Aksu said.
In Aksu's view, the Chinese should not be perceived as tourists. They have the spirit of a traveler. ""They have a different understanding of tourism and want to explore new adventures and discover new places, areas, and destinations. So, as a country, we attach great importance to them.""
According to Aksu, TÃ¼rkiye's tourism sector wants to attract 1 million travelers from China.
After hosting over 420,000 Chinese tourists in 2019, TÃ¼rkiye had initially projected to attract nearly 1 million by the end of 2020. However, most activities were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""We are waiting for our Chinese brothers and sisters, and we intend to give them a taste of TÃ¼rkiye's vast unexplored paradise,"" Aksu said. ""We are doing all our preparations for them.""

"Overnight clashes between Yemeni gov't forces, tribal gunmen kill 5","ADEN, Yemen, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- At least five people were killed in intense clashes on Tuesday night between government forces and tribal gunmen in the southern Yemeni province of Abyan, a military official told Xinhua on Wednesday.
""The tribal gunmen stormed a key military site of the government forces in Abyan's district of Lawdar, sparking hours of intense clashes late Tuesday night,"" the local military source said on condition of anonymity.
The clashes that lasted several hours killed at least five people, including three soldiers, and injured several others from both sides, he said.
The armed confrontations were caused by disputes over the deployment of patrols in the area between the two sides, the source noted.
The security authorities in Abyan have set up an investigation committee and managed to cease the hostilities following a meeting with local military commanders and tribal leaders, according to the source.
During the past months, military units of the Southern Transitional Council, which is a part of the Yemeni government, announced they were launching ""a qualitative anti-terror operation and succeeded in raiding a key hideout of al-Qaida in Abyan.""
Scores of al-Qaida militants hiding out in rocky and mountainous areas of Abyan and other neighboring provinces frequently carry out hit-and-run raids against Yemeni government forces.
The Yemen-based al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula network has exploited years of deadly conflict between the Yemeni government and the Houthi militia to expand its presence in the war-ravaged Arab country. It has carried out many high-profile attacks against the security forces in the country's southern provinces.

Croatia not to impose restrictive COVID measures on Chinese passengers,"ZAGREB, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- Croatia will not impose restrictive COVID-19 measures on Chinese passengers entering the country, Bernard Kaic, head of the Department for Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases at the Croatian Institute of Public Health (HZJZ), said on Wednesday.
""Since we do not consider mandatory inspections an efficient method for the prevention of the COVID-19 variants into the country, we do not intend to impose mandatory inspections, as long as it is not a requirement of all EU (European Union) member states,"" Kaic, authorized by the Croatian Ministry of Health, told Xinhua in an interview.
Croatia will not follow the examples of some Western European countries to take restrictive COVID-19 measures on Chinese passengers, Kaic said, noting that the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has said that it is ""unjustified"" and unnecessary to impose mandatory inspections on passengers from China.
As the COVID-19 virus is already present in Croatia and all over the EU, ""it is no big deal if a Chinese passenger with COVID-19 virus enters Croatia,"" Kaic noted.
Croatia welcomes Chinese tourists and ""we look forward to their arrival and there are no obstacles for that,"" Kaic added.
""We warmly welcome Chinese tourists, because they are our dear guests,"" said Kristijan Stanicic, director of the Croatian National Tourist Board (CNTB), adding that the CNTB will do everything to facilitate the arrival and stay of Chinese tourists in Croatia.

NEW YORK, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of nurses from New York City's Mount Sinai Hospital and Montefiore Bronx continued to be on strike the third day on staffing shortage, low wage and other issues.
Hundreds of nurses wearing red hats continued to line both sides of Madison Avenue near the entrance of Mount Sinai Hospital on Wednesday morning.
Meanwhile, another smaller group of nurses rallied at the 5th Avenue on another side of Mount Sinai Hospital complex.
Nurses called for more nurses and enforcement of safe staffing requirements while complaining heft salaries and bonuses for management of the hospitals.
Minna Scott, a registered nurse at Mount Sinai Hospital, told Xinhua, ""99 percent of nurses have voted to authorize the strike and we're all out here rallying on the street.""
Mount Sinai is a private hospital, so it is not under the laws of the New York State to enforce any of the labor laws including that on staffing ratio, according to Scott.
Currently, there are over 500 vacancies of nurses and nurses have to work overtime because of short staffing, said Scott.
""Every day there are more nurses leaving the hospital, not only because they are tired, not because they have enough, but because they are refusing to practice under unsafe labor,"" added Scott.
""Nurses do not get paid enough. The head of this hospital, according to the Internal Revenue Service, makes 12,437,000 dollars a year. Sure, they could support the nurses and give them raises,"" said Lorraine Skeen, a retired teacher, who came out in solidarity with nurses.
It's reported that around 7,000 nurses from the two hospitals joined the strike while Mount Sinai Morningside and Mount Sinai West reached a tentative agreement with the state nursing union on a new contract Sunday with a strike avoided.
The strike will continue until agreements can be reached and the key sticking point in negotiations is making sure there are enough nurses at the bedside to safely care for patients, said a release by the New York State Nurses Association on Wednesday.

Biggest Australian polluters forced to lower emissions by 4.9 pct annually,"CANBERRA, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government has announced it will impose stricter carbon emissions limits on the country's biggest polluters.
Under the revamped safeguard mechanism, Australia's 215 biggest industrial polluters will be forced to cut their emissions by 30 percent by 2030.
From July 1, the facilities will be subject to a binding pollution cap that will fall by 4.9 percent every year.
The safeguard mechanism is the Labor government's signature climate policy and will be the first legislation that compels the industry to cut emissions since the carbon tax was repealed in 2014.
Chris Bowen, minister for climate change and energy, told reporters on Tuesday that the policy would ensure big polluters do their bit to help Australia achieve its goal to reduce emissions by 43 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.
""Facilities covered by the safeguard mechanism are responsible for almost a third of Australia's emissions,"" Bowen said.
""Twenty-eight percent of emissions come from them -- we will require 28 percent of emissions reduction to come from safeguard facilities,"" he added.

"Biden says ""surprised"" to learn classified documents taken to his private office","WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Joe Biden said on Tuesday that he was ""surprised"" that government records were taken to one of his former private offices.
""I was surprised to learn there were any government records that were taken there to that office,"" Biden told reporters in Mexico City where he had a trilateral summit with the leaders of Mexico and Canada.
Biden said he doesn't know ""what's in the documents"" that were found in a locked closet when his attorneys were vacating office space at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, D.C.
The Penn Biden Center is a think tank not far from the White House, affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania and named for Biden, a veteran Democrat who served as U.S. vice president from January 2009 to January 2017.
White House special counsel Richard Sauber issued a statement on Monday, saying that Biden periodically used this space from mid-2017 until the start of his 2020 presidential campaign.
This discovery of ""what appears to be Obama-Biden Administration records, including a small number of documents with classified markings"" was made in early November of 2022, according to the statement.
""They found some documents in a box in a locked cabinet, or at least a closet. And as soon as they did, they realized there were several classified documents in that box,"" Biden said on Tuesday.
The attorneys ""did what they should have done"" by immediately calling the National Archives, he added.
The classified documents found inside the Penn Biden Center closet are reportedly U.S. intelligence memos and briefing materials that covered topics including Ukraine, Iran and Britain.
U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland is said to have tasked the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois John Lausch Jr. with reviewing the matter.
U.S. Congressman James Comer, a Republican who chairs the House Oversight Committee, told CNN that he plans to press the National Archives, which his committee oversees, for information about the classified documents.
The U.S. Department of Justice is also investigating former President Donald Trump's handling of a trove of classified documents seized from his estate in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, by federal agents in the summer of 2022.
Trump, a Republican, responded to the news of classified documents found at the Penn Biden Center, posting on social media on Monday that ""when is the FBI going to raid the many homes of Joe Biden, perhaps even the White House?""
""President Biden has been very critical of President Trump mistakenly taking classified documents to the residence or wherever, and now it seems he may have done the same,"" Comer said. ""How ironic.""
The Presidential Records Act requires all presidential and vice-presidential documents to be turned over to the National Archives.

How to feed 8 bln people -- a look at global food security in 2023,"
BEIJING, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- As the world's population hit a new milestone of 8 billion people in 2022, the task of ensuring global food security has become even more critical.
However, due to climate change, geopolitical crises and a global economic slowdown, the international food market is expected to remain uncertain in 2023, and some low-income countries may remain trapped in the food shortage dilemma.
If history is any guide, a global crisis necessitates global cooperation. Only by strengthening coordination, facilitating supply chains, and focusing on eliminating long-term and structurally persistent problems that undermine the resilience of the global food system will the international community be able to better meet global food security challenges.

LINGERING FOOD SECURITY THREATS
2022 saw a rapid increase in food prices and shortages of food supplies around the world. ""The world is facing a food crisis of unprecedented proportions, the largest in modern history,"" the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) said in a report last year.
In its joint research with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the WFP found that as many as 828 million people go to bed hungry every night.
The compounding food security crisis in various parts of the world was caused by a combination of geopolitical and economic crises, as well as global warming. Unfortunately, the factors that contributed to the crisis last year are still in place.
Both Russia and Ukraine are important grain exporters, and Russia is also a major fertilizer exporter. According to figures by the WFP, Russia and Ukraine together account for 30 percent of global wheat exports.
In February 2022, international food prices rose in response to the escalation of the Ukraine crisis, exacerbating the food crisis. In March 2022, the FAO Food Price Index reached its highest level on record since 1990, at 159.7 points.
Though grain exports from Russia are not officially subject to sanctions against Russia, the West has erected ""invisible barriers"" to Russian agricultural exports, Eduard Zernin, head of the Russian Union of Grain Exporters, told Interfax.
What's worse, the United States has coerced its allies into tightening sanctions against Russia, affecting international energy and fertilizer supplies and driving up agricultural input costs, which could affect global agricultural production in the coming growing season and further drive up food prices.
Multiple heat and drought events in the Northern Hemisphere in 2022 also hampered winter wheat production in several major producing regions, and global corn production is also expected to be lower than the previous year's level. Due to limited international supply, wheat and corn prices will remain volatile in 2023 and highly sensitive to changes in weather conditions and related policies.
Meanwhile, some major economies are currently in recession or experiencing significant slowing, and the global economic downturn poses risks to food security.

EQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF FOOD URGENTLY NEEDED
Last December, the FAO projected that global cereal production would be 2.756 billion tons in 2022, based on separate cereal supply and demand estimates. Observers believe that despite the fact that the global population has reached 8 billion, there should no longer be a food security crisis given the total global food production.
The unequal distribution of food between and within countries has caused hunger for many millions of people worldwide.
In the past decades, the core exporting countries have been stable and concentrated, while the core importing countries have been relatively dispersed. Food self-sufficiency is particularly low in developing countries as a whole. In Africa, for example, more than 30 countries are net food importers.
Because of this supply and demand pattern, the international food market is highly vulnerable to epidemics, regional conflicts and other factors.
In recent years, many food exporting countries have implemented protectionist policies, citing concerns over food supply and rising food prices.
As of July 2022, 21 countries had implemented food export bans and six countries had implemented export restrictions, according to data from the International Food Policy Research Institute. If major food exporting countries tighten trade restrictions, international food prices will undoubtedly rise.
The continued aggressive interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the appreciation of the U.S. dollar have also resulted in a significant increase in the financial burden on some low-income countries, which are highly dependent on food imports, further threatening the food security of vulnerable groups.
Meanwhile, Western companies at the heart of the global grain trade have enjoyed a record bonanza as global food prices soar, raising concerns of profiteering and speculation in global food markets.
In an interview with The Guardian, Olivier De Schutter, former UN special rapporteur on the right to food, said that the fact that global commodity giants, mainly the Archer Daniels Midland Company, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus, are making record profits at a time when hunger is rising ""is clearly unjust, and is a terrible indictment of our food systems.""
""Global grain markets are even more concentrated than energy markets and even less transparent, so there is a huge risk of profiteering,"" said De Schutter, noting that the food price surge in 2022 happened despite what were thought to be abundant global grain reserves.
There was insufficient transparency from the companies to show how much grain they hold and no way to force them to release stocks in a timely way, he said.

MULTILATERAL COOPERATION AS COMMON CHALLENGE
Despite the recent drop in global food prices, the issue of food supply and security stays unaddressed. How to eliminate the threat of food security remains a common challenge for the international community in the new year.
In the face of this common threat, food security has emerged as a major concern at major international multilateral conferences in recent years.
During the 12th Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in June 2022, the Ministerial Declaration on the Emergency Response to Food Insecurity was issued, the first multilateral declaration addressing the issue of food insecurity in WTO history. It stresses members' concerns about trade disruptions, record-high prices and excessive price volatility for food and agricultural products as threats to world food security.
During the 17th Group of 20 (G20) Summit in Indonesia's resort island of Bali in November 2022, leaders pledged to take urgent actions to address the vulnerabilities of developing countries, and called for an accelerated transformation towards sustainable and resilient agriculture and food systems and supply chains.
""We will take further coordinated actions to address food security challenges including price surges and shortage of food commodities and fertilizers globally,"" said the G20 Bali Leaders' Declaration.
On how international trade can help achieve more efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable food systems, Dominique Fernand Burgeon, director of the FAO liaison office with the United Nations in Geneva, said that to reduce disruptions to global agricultural trade, the first step should be to improve market transparency and promote policy dialogue.
Countries should consider the potential damage to international markets from trade restrictive measures, and vigorously implement trade facilitation measures and carry out international cooperation, he said at an international conference on agricultural trade policy last November.
To feed the world's 8 billion people, the international community should promote free trade and keep food trade flowing smoothly, with a particular focus on resolving the disruptions in the food supply chain caused by the Ukraine crisis as soon as possible, said Tang Jian, a vice professor from the Institute for International Strategic Studies of the Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
The major countries should also collaborate on how to provide global public goods, with the United Nations taking the lead, Tang said, adding that an early warning system for the food market should be established in order to predict which regions may face food crises and take precautions accordingly.

While fetal deaths decreased by 5 percent for Black mothers between 2020 and 2021, their rates remained significantly higher than white mothers, according to the study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday.
For Black mothers, the rate was 9.8 per 1,000 live births and fetal deaths in 2021, compared to white mothers' rate of 4.8, CDC data showed.
The first year of the pandemic, the rate for Black fetal deaths was 10.34 and in 2019 the rate was 10.41, all more than double the rate white and Hispanic mothers experienced.
Fetal mortality rates count deaths in gestation or stillbirths and do not include abortions or miscarriages. The CDC defines a miscarriage as a pregnancy loss before 20 weeks of gestational age.

"With pandemic aid gone, U.S. schools owe for free meals: report","NEW YORK, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- As schools around the United States reopen after winter break, their students are being reminded of the lunch debt they've racked up this school year.
This is ""an ugly reality that follows the end of federal assistance that paid for school meals for more than 50 million students during the pandemic,"" reported USA Today on Friday.
Congress ended the free-lunch-for-all program in June, reverting to a system in which low-income families had to fill out paperwork to qualify for aid based on their income.
""But some families have been left behind because they do not understand the application process, and others are rejected because they do not qualify,"" said the report. A family of four must earn about 36,000 U.S. dollars a year or less to qualify for free lunch.
Schools often feed these students, requiring them to pay later and creating a debt many families cannot pay down. For some children, the debt can get so big that schools stop giving them a full meal.

Boosted security measures at U.S. schools fail to contain gun violence: media,"NEW YORK, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- Even as U.S. schools spend billions of dollars on security, the number of gun incidents on campus has only grown, reported The New York Times on Thursday.
Last year, more than 330 people were fatally shot or wounded on school grounds, up from 218 in 2018, according to the K-12 School Shooting Database, a research project that tracks instances in which a gun is fired or brandished on school property.
The overall number of incidents, which can include cases where no one was injured, also increased to more than 300, up from about 120 in 2018, and as few as 22 in 1999, according to the report.
""The uptick in school gun violence comes amid a broader increase in active shooter incidents and gun deaths in the United States. Overall, schools are still quite safe,"" the report noted.
U.S. schools have amped up security over the past five years, with about two-thirds of public schools now controlling access to school grounds, not just the building, during the school day, up from about half in the 2017-2018 school year.
An estimated 43 percent of public schools have a ""panic button"" or silent alarm that connect directly with the police in case of emergency, up from 29 percent five years ago, according to the report.

XBB.1.5 powering COVID hospitalizations in New York to highest level in a year: Fortune,"NEW YORK, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- New York COVID-19 hospitalizations are at their highest level in nearly a year just after a new, ultra-transmissible COVID variant XBB.1.5, known as Kraken, achieved dominance in the northeast United States, reported The Fortune magazine early this week.
Current in-state COVID-19 hospitalizations are near 4,000, the highest level since February, according to the New York State Department of Health.
""It's unlikely that the XBB.1.5 subvariant is solely responsible for the increase in hospitalizations, given recent holiday gatherings and other seasonal factors known to drive up cases each winter,"" said the report.
But the increase concerns experts given that the new variant was recently declared the most transmissible yet by the World Health Organization, and also due to New York's track record as a bellwether state for the rest of the country when it comes to COVID-19, it said.
It's ""certainly possible"" that the regional rise in hospitalizations is a sign of things to come for the rest of the nation, Michael Merson, visiting professor at New York University's School of Global Public Health, was quoted as saying.

COVID winters make long hospital waits new normal in U.S.: media,"LOS ANGELES, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- As the United States enters its third full COVID winter, officials are warning that the permanence of the coronavirus in the disease landscape could mean brutal and long-lasting seasonal surges of cold-weather illnesses for years to come, said a report of The Washington Post.
It will result in hospitals struggling to care for non-COVID emergencies and unable to give patients timely, lifesaving treatments, said the report published on Wednesday.
Winter has traditionally been crunchtime for hospitals because of influenza and another seasonal pathogen, respiratory syncytial virus. Now SARS-CoV-2 has joined them to form an unholy trinity of pathogens that surge in the cold months, said the report.
White House COVID-19 response coordinator Ashish Jha said the American health-care system may not be able to withstand the continued viral onslaught, straining the system's ability to care for other serious illnesses, the repot said.

Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5 accounts for nearly half U.S. new COVID-19 infections,"LOS ANGELES, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- Omicron new subvariant XBB.1.5 is estimated to account for 43 percent of the COVID-19 cases in the United States for the week ending Jan. 14, according to data released Friday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The subvariant XBB.1.5 is spreading quickly in the United States. It made up 30.4 percent of the total cases in the week ending Jan. 7, rising from 20.1 percent from a week before and 11.8 percent from two weeks prior, according to the CDC.
XBB.1.5 is currently the most transmissible variant in the country. The World Health Organization said earlier this week XBB.1.5 may spur more COVID-19 cases based on genetic characteristics and early growth rate estimates.
Another two dominant Omicron subvariants BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 accounted for about 45 percent of new COVID-19 cases in the United States in the latest week, CDC data showed.

Peace remains elusive in U.S. as gun violence haunts: The Guardian,"LONDON, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- It remains difficult for the United States to achieve peace due to the stubborn issue of gun violence, The Guardian said in a review of American writer Paul Auster's book Bloodbath Nation.
""America's relationship to the gun is anything but rational ... and therefore we have done little or nothing to fix the problem,"" the review, published on Wednesday, quoted Auster's book as saying.
The fix to U.S. gun violence does not reside in banning the manufacture and sale of all guns -- because attempting to do so would be as impractical and ineffective as the banning of alcohol during prohibition, which criminalized ordinary people and created a flourishing black market, the review said while summarizing the points in Auster's book.
""Peace will break out only when both sides want it, and in order for that to happen, we would first have to conduct an honest, gut-wrenching examination of who we are and who we want to be as a people going forward into the future, which necessarily would have to begin with an honest gut-wrenching examination of who we have been in the past,"" it quoted Auster's book as saying.
""Peace is not going to break out -- because one side does not want peace,"" said The Guardian review, citing the polarizing rhetoric of the National Rifle Association and its allies, who regarded every mass shooting as an opportunity to argue for more guns not fewer.

Omicron new subvariant strains U.S. hospitals amid fast spread,"LOS ANGELES, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- Omicron new subvariant XBB.1.5 is spreading quickly in the United States during the third COVID-19 winter, straining U.S. hospital systems and causing staffing shortages.
XBB.1.5 is estimated to account for 43 percent of COVID-19 cases in the United States for the week ending Jan. 14, according to data released Friday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
XBB.1.5 is currently the most transmissible variant in the country. It made up 30.4 percent of the total cases in the week ending Jan. 7, rising from 20.1 percent from a week before and 11.8 percent from two weeks prior, according to the CDC.
The World Health Organization said earlier this week XBB.1.5 may spur more COVID-19 cases based on genetic characteristics and early growth rate estimates.
Public health officials are closely monitoring the spread of XBB.1.5, the most transmissible form of the coronavirus yet seen.
The mutations XBB.1.5 has acquired have made it more contagious. A more transmissible strain has the evolutionary advantage that it will spread faster than others, and therefore could displace other strains, according to health experts.
However, this new strain does not appear to cause more severe disease. Like other Omicron descendants, it probably causes milder illness compared with the Delta variants that predated Omicron.
There are some studies that suggest XBB.1.5 is more immune-evasive compared with previously dominant Omicron strains. Further research is underway to identify the degree of immune protection afforded by existing vaccines.
The rise in the new variant correlated with an uptick in COVID-19 cases in United States over the last six weeks.
Winter has traditionally been crunchtime for hospitals because of influenza and another seasonal pathogen, respiratory syncytial virus. Now SARS-CoV-2 has joined them to form an unholy trinity of pathogens that surge in the cold months.
With respiratory viruses across the country, hospitals nationwide are facing severe shortages of beds and staff to provide adequate care for patients.
White House COVID-19 response coordinator Ashish Jha said the American health-care system may not be able to withstand the continued viral onslaught, which strains the system's ability to care for other serious illnesses.
As the United States enters the third full COVID-19 winter, officials are warning the permanence of the coronavirus in the disease landscape could mean brutal and long-lasting seasonal surges of cold-weather illnesses for years to come, said a report of The Washington Post.
""I am worried that we are going to have, for years, our health system being pretty dysfunctional, not being able to take care of heart attack patients, not being able to take care of cancer patients, not being able to take care of the kid who's got appendicitis because we're going to be so overwhelmed with respiratory viruses for ... three or four months a year,"" Jha told the newspaper.

Following the availability and use of the updated vaccine, CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink, a near real-time surveillance system, met the statistical criteria to prompt additional investigation into ""whether there was a safety concern"" for ischemic stroke in people aged 65 and older who received the updated vaccine, according to a statement on the CDC website.
The investigation ""raised a question of whether"" stroke risk was elevated in the 21-day period post-vaccination versus 22 to 44 days post-vaccination, according to the CDC.
A preliminary study using the U.S. Veterans Affairs database did not indicate an increased risk of ischemic stroke following the updated vaccine, according to the CDC.
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System managed by CDC and FDA has not seen an increase in reporting of ischemic strokes following the vaccine.
Pfizer and BioNTech said in a statement that ""there is no evidence to conclude that ischemic stroke is associated with the use of the companies' COVID-19 vaccines.""

During the meeting with Swedish ambassador Mattias Lentz, whose country currently holds the presidency of the Council of the European Union, the Director General of the Western Europe department at the Iranian Foreign Ministry condemned any interference in Iran's internal affairs, stressing that justifying insults to religious and national values of other nations on the ground of freedom is a betrayal of the sacred concept of freedom and cruelty to human beings and human rights.

Global warming driving shift in water cycle: Australian study,"CANBERRA, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- An Australian report has warned that global warming is changing the global water cycle.
The Global Water Monitor Consortium, led by the Australian National University (ANU), on Thursday released its first report, warning that flash droughts will become more common in the short-term future.
According to the report, the water cycle in 2022 was dominated by warmer-than-average ocean waters in the western Pacific and eastern and northern Indian Ocean, driving severe heat waves in South Asia and a severe monsoon that caused flooding in Pakistan.
In Europe and China, it said heat waves caused droughts to develop rapidly while a third consecutive La Ni a event caused catastrophic flooding in Australia but exacerbated droughts in North and South America.
Overall air temperature over land followed the long-term warming trend in 2022 while humidity declined.
""This means that nature, crops and people will need more water to stay healthy, which compounds the problem,"" Albert van Dijk, lead author of the report from the Centre for Water and Landscape Dynamics at ANU's Fenner School of Environment and Society, said in a media release.
""It is a safe prediction that we will see more and more of these heatwaves and flash droughts. We also see evidence of the impact of global warming on glaciers and the water cycle in cold regions, and in fact melting glaciers contributed to the Pakistan floods. That will continue until those glaciers are gone.""
The first-of-its-kind report was compiled using water measurements made at thousands of ground stations and by satellites.
It forecast that dry conditions would intensify droughts in the Americas, Asia and the Horn of Africa in 2023 but said unwinding La Ni a conditions could offer some respite.
Van Dijk said it was too early to tell if the three consecutive La Ni a years were a coincidence or an indication of a trend.
""If La Ni a or El Ni o patterns are going to stay around longer in future, that is going to cause a lot of trouble, with worse, longer droughts and worse floods alike,"" he said.

U.S. has problem with primacy in Asia: Foreign Affairs magazine,"NEW YORK, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States' global power has diminished over the past generation, making it harder for Washington to direct the world and maintain its self-presumed prowess in Asia, said an article published in the Foreign Affairs magazine on Monday.
""Even if U.S. primacy was once a source of regional stability, there is little basis to think it will promote harmony today,"" said the article.
Two of the most recent U.S. presidents -- Barack Obama and Donald Trump -- charged themselves with the task of ""indefinitely propping up the sun,"" and President Joe Biden has picked up where both presidents left off, according to the article.
""Biden has increased the U.S. military buildup, facilitated a regional military buildup, and attempted to assemble the beginnings of an anti-Chinese containment coalition along with local Asian powers,"" it said.
These choices go against what the preservation of peace demands. Kneecapping China's economy, engaging in an endless arms race, aligning with regional countries to encircle Beijing, and alienating smaller countries by demanding that they choose between China and the United States might give Washington more short-term power in Asia, according to the article.
""But these are the ingredients of regional fracture and eventual war, not stability. The United States' Asia policy, then, is at an unacknowledged crossroads. Washington can support regional peace or pursue regional primacy, but it cannot do both,"" it added.

"Japanese PM's G7 tour seeks gang-up, growing int'l presence","TOKYO, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has toured five of the Group of Seven (G7) nations at the beginning of the new year, after controversial moves on security policy triggered concerns among its Asian neighbors in December 2022.
Scholars warned that the Japanese government should change its ""subordinative"" relationship with the United States and an open diplomacy with Asian neighbors is the foundation of Japan's national security.
During his trip to France, Italy, Britain, Canada and the United States on Jan. 9-15, Kishida signed a reciprocal access defence agreement for closer defense and security ties with his British counterpart Rishi Sunak, and issued a joint statement with U.S. President Joe Biden reiterating the Japan-U.S. alliance in the so-called ""Indo-Pacific strategy.""
Since Kishida's government updated its security strategy last month in contravention of its exclusively defense-oriented policy, its series of actions have increasingly raised alarms among its Asian neighbors, said local scholars, urging the government to change its relations with the United States from ""subordination"" to ""self-reliance.""
FREE RIDER ON U.S. HEGEMONY
Friday's U.S.-Japan summit, the main focus of Kishida's week-long tour, marked his first Washington visit as the Japanese premier, who attached utmost importance to the debut trip and made ""full preparations"" beforehand.
In December last year, Japan approved three updated documents on its security and defense policies, including the new National Security Strategy, the National Defense Strategy, and the Defense Buildup Program, vowing to gain ""counterstrike capability,"" or ""enemy base strike capabilities.""
Japan's annual defense outlays are also set to surge. The government intends to secure about 313 billion U.S. dollars in defense spending for the five years from fiscal 2023.
Analysts pointed out that the United States in recent years has dominated the Australia-India-Japan-U.S. Quadrilateral in the Asia-Pacific region, peddling the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework while forming cliques and divided camps.
Since taking office in October 2021, Kishida's cabinet is so willing to spearhead the expansion of U.S. hegemony in the Asia-Pacific that it courted the United States by arming itself, while relying on the latter for army expansion and war preparation, paving the way for its dream of becoming a military power again.
During the U.S.-Japan meeting, the most severe and complex security environment in the Indo-Pacific region was repeatedly brought up. While Kishida explained to Biden the changes in Japan's security policy, the U.S. president ""commended"" Japan's defense upgrade and its ""historic"" defense budget hike.
According to the joint statement issued on Friday, the two sides agreed to further strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance not only in terms of security but also in economic ties to secure their edge on emerging technologies including semiconductors.
Prior to the meeting, foreign and defense chiefs from the two sides held 2-plus-2 defense talks, or the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee on Wednesday, vowing to address their ""greatest strategic challenge.""
The ministers agreed to strengthen military ties, deepen cooperation regarding Japan's decision to possess counterattack capabilities, expand joint use of U.S. and Japanese facilities and extend the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty into space.
Atsushi Koketsu, emeritus professor at Yamaguchi University of Japan, said the Japanese government, following the U.S. intention, has turned to a ""preemptive attack strategy"" by abandoning the ""exclusive defense"" concept, putting its Asian neighbors on alert.
Kishida's practice of ""free riding"" on the U.S. hegemony has roused discontent among the Japanese public.
DISTURBING SEEKER OF DEFENSE CO-OP
As the current G7 chair, Japan will host the group's summit in May. Kishida's visit to the five G7 countries is also aimed at garnering support on a host of issues including food security, nuclear disarmament, climate change and Russia-Ukraine conflict before the summit in Hiroshima.
Since last October, four ministers have resigned successively from Kishida's cabinet due to scandals, plunging the government's approval ratings to record lows. Meanwhile, former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga criticized Kishida recently for remaining as the head of a political faction within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party while leading the country, an additional blow to Kishida.
As multiple crises unfold, Kishida intends to take advantage of Japan's G7 presidency, as well as its election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council and the council's rotating president in January, to engage in vigorous diplomacy and create a sense of presence by forming cliques, in a bid to ensure a successful G7 Hiroshima summit and boost his flagging approval ratings.
During the visit, the Kishida government, abandoner of its exclusively defense-oriented policy and pacifism embodied in the Constitution of Japan, is seeking to strengthen defense and security cooperation with the United States and European countries wherever possible.
In London, for example, Kishida and Sunak signed the Japan-Britain Reciprocal Access Agreement aimed at facilitating bilateral defense and security cooperation, stating simplified procedures for Japan-Britain cooperation in ship berthing and joint exercises in the future, and expecting more active military cooperation between the two countries.
Liu Di, a professor at Japan's Kyorin University, said Japan's economy has been stagnant for the past 30 years and it will inevitably lead to a host of domestic conflicts if the world's third largest economy continues to hike defense spending.
Therefore, Japan may use external forces to strengthen its comprehensive security capabilities, including leveraging other developed countries within the G7 framework, the scholar said.
Ukeru Magosaki, a former Japanese foreign ministry official, told Xinhua that the economic weather in Japan is not optimistic, and most Japanese people do not approve of raising taxes or issuing government bonds to increase defense expenditure.
Koketsu said the urgent task for the Japanese government is to transform its relations with the U.S. from ""subordination"" to ""self-reliance"" and carry out an open diplomacy with its Asian neighbors.
This would be the foundation of Japan's guarantee for national security, he noted.

Japanese public opposes plan to dump radioactive water into sea,"TOKYO, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government's latest radioactive wastewater discharge plan scheduled for this spring or summer is facing an angry backlash among the public, especially those in the fishing industry, who felt uneasy about the decision.
The Japanese government on Friday said a controversial plan to release radioactive wastewater from the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan's northeast into the Pacific Ocean will start in the spring or summer.
Japan's dumping of the nuclear-contaminated water into the sea is suspected of violating the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, as well as the 1996 protocol to the convention, Masahide Kimura, member of a Japanese anti-nuclear campaign group, told Xinhua.
Such a plan also violates the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, as Japan's foreign ministry admitted that the area where the discharge occurred is not of inland waters, Kimura said.
Kimura believed that spreading radioactive materials should not be allowed, as only storage is the means of prevention, and efforts should be prioritized to stop the inflow of groundwater and prevent the continued increase of nuclear-contaminated water.
Japan's environment ministry has not yet assessed the environmental impact of the decades-long discharge of the nuclear-contaminated water into the North Pacific Ocean, he noted.
""The opposition to the discharge of treated water into the ocean has not changed in the slightest,"" Masanobu Sakamoto, president of the National Fisheries Cooperative Federation of Japan, said in a statement on Friday, demanding a serious response from the government.
Government support for the fishing industry is essential to make up for the damage done to its reputation, Takuya Tasso, governor of Japan's Iwate Prefecture, told the press.
Despite strengthened information released by the government and Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) since last December, the discharge plan at present has not yet gained the ""full understanding of citizens and fishery stakeholders,"" according to Hiroyuki Uchida, mayor of Iwaki, Fukushima Prefecture.
Uchida hoped that the government and TEPCO would earnestly fulfill their original commitment, which meant no disposal of the nuclear-polluted water will be carried out without the understanding of relevant parties.
An official with the Miyagi Prefecture Fisheries Co-operative told the press that they will continue to express opposition, ensuring that fishermen do not suffer losses while firmly stating what is necessary to sustain their livelihoods.
In fact, the government's plan to dump the contaminated water into the sea has been opposed by civil groups in Japan since it was launched in April 2021.
Last September, a joint petition of 42,000 people opposing the discharge plan and demanding other ways to deal with the contaminated water was submitted to TEPCO and Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry by representatives from livelihood co-operative societies in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures as well as the fisheries association of Miyagi.
About 51 percent of respondents were ""against"" and ""relatively opposed"" to the idea of discharging the filtered wastewater into the sea after diluting it to national standards, according to a survey by the country's public broadcaster NHK at the end of 2020.
A poll published by the Asahi Shimbun in early 2021 showed that 55 percent surveyed were opposed to the disposal of the nuclear-contaminated water into the sea after treatment.

Investigation reveals officials conceal civilian deaths in U.S. drone strike in Kabul,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- A military investigation recently disclosed by U.S. media revealed that U.S. officials knew shortly after a U.S.-launched drone strike in Kabul, Afghanistan in August 2021 in which civilians were killed, but top military officers tried to conceal the facts by making misleading statements in the ensuing weeks.
INTENTIONAL LIES
According to part of a partially redacted investigation report, which the New York Times said in a Jan. 6 report it gained through a lawsuit against the U.S. Central Command, top U.S. commanders in Afghanistan were notified within hours after the Aug. 29, 2021 drone strike near the Kabul International Airport that at least three children were killed.
Possible civilian casualties were reported within 20 minutes following the strike by U.S. military analysts, who assessed that at least three children were killed about two to three hours after the attack, the Times reported, citing the investigation.
In their sworn statements for the probe, six of the nine witnesses said they learned immediately after the strike that the missile hit an area where there were civilians who might have been killed as a result.
In the ensuing weeks, however, top military officials repeatedly refused to confirm the civilian deaths, with the commander of the Central Command, Kenneth McKenzie, saying on the day of the attack that while the ""possibilities"" of civilian casualties were being assessed, there were ""no indications at this time.""
Three days after, Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, defended the operation as ""righteous.""
It was not until Sept. 17 that McKenzie finally acknowledged that 10 civilians, including seven children, were killed in that botched strike the United States carried out under extreme pressure.
CONCEALED TRUTH
The ill-advised operation was a preemptive move foiling what intelligence personnel claimed to be a plan by the Islamic State's Afghan branch, ISIS-K, to bomb U.S. troops conducting a hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan at the time.
Since the attack, multiple outside investigations have found out that the target, Zemari Ahmadi, was not an ISIS member. Quite on the contrary, he was a longtime Afghan contractor working for a California-based aid group. Others killed in the incident were Ahmadi's family members.
On that day, Ahmadi was driving his white Toyota Carolla, which U.S. intelligence officers mistakenly believed were loaded with explosives to be used to bomb U.S. troops, to take colleagues to and from work. What were perceived as explosives in the trunk turned out to be jugs of water Ahmadi brought home for the family to drink.
""We now assess that it is unlikely that the vehicle and those who died were associated with ISIS-K or were a direct threat to U.S. forces,"" McKenzie said at the Sept. 17, 2021, press briefing at the Pentagon. ""It was a mistake.""
A subsequent review led by the Air Force inspector general, Sami Said, remains classified, the New York Times reported. But Said acknowledged that confirmation bias was an important factor in how Ahmadi became a target, which is a tendency to look for, analyze or remember information in a way that supports an existing belief.
DIFFICULT JUSTICE CLAIM
""When confirmation bias was so deadly in this case, you have to ask how many other people targeted by the military over the years were also unjustly killed,"" Hina Shamsi, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer representing families of victims, was quoted by the Times as saying.
She said the investigation gained by the Times ""makes clear that military personnel saw what they wanted to see and not reality, which was an Afghan aid worker going about his daily life.""
Emal Ahmadi, Zemari's brother whose toddler Malika was also killed in the strike, told Xinhua in an interview days after the tragedy that the United States launching airstrikes that killed innocent civilians, including children, was heinous war crimes, and that those responsible must be held to account.
The Defense Department has said it would not punish those carrying out the strike. It has promised to compensate Zemari's surviving relatives with condolence payments, but none of them have received the monetary assistance so far.

Russia to evacuate astronauts from ISS amid emergency,"MOSCOW, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia will launch the unmanned Soyuz MS-23 spacecraft to bring home three astronauts from the International Space Station (ISS) as their Soyuz MS-22 spaceship has an emergency situation, Russian space authorities said Saturday.
Russian cosmonauts Sergei Prokopyev and Dmitry Petelin together with NASA astronaut Francisco Rubio will return to Earth aboard the Soyuz MS-23 in the next weeks, which is supposed to dock to the ISS on Feb. 22, Russia's space agency Roscosmos said in a statement.
Last month, astronauts found damage to the outer skin of the instrument-assembly compartment of the Soyuz MS-22 docked to the ISS, which caused a pressure drop in the cooling system.
The systems of the ISS and the Soyuz MS-22 are operating normally, but Roscosmos and its partner space agencies have taken measures to ensure the safe return of the crew to Earth in the event of an accident before the arrival of Soyuz MS-23, the statement said.
The Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft blasted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Sept. 21, 2022, taking Prokopyev, Petelin and Rubio to the ISS for a six-month stay in orbit.

BEIJING, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has made remarkable achievements in counterterrorism and deradicalization, and has fully implemented the country's policy on freedom of religious belief, according to world-renowned Islamic religious figures and scholars.
From Jan. 8 to 11, Ali Rashid Al Nuaimi, chairman of the World Muslim Communities Council, led a delegation of more than 30 Islamic religious figures and scholars from 14 countries to visit Xinjiang.
After seeing an exhibition on Xinjiang's anti-terrorism and deradicalization in Urumqi, the regional capital, the delegation said they believed that Xinjiang has made remarkable achievements in anti-terrorism and deradicalization, and achieved the peaceful coexistence of all ethnic groups and social harmony, said Xu Guixiang, a spokesperson for the Xinjiang regional government, at a press conference held in Beijing.
The delegation visited the Xinjiang Islamic Institute and mosques in Urumqi and in the city of Kashgar. The members believed that Xinjiang has fully implemented China's policy on freedom of religious belief, ensured normal religious activities in accordance with the law, and actively promoted religious, social and ethnic harmony, said Elijian Anayit, another spokesperson for the Xinjiang regional government.
After visiting a museum in Urumqi and a memorial hall and the old town in Kashgar, and watching Uygur Muqam art performances, they noted that Xinjiang attaches great importance to the protection and development of the fine traditional cultures of ethnic minority groups, and that all ethnic groups respect, appreciate and learn from each other in terms of culture, Xu said.
They also visited the Urumqi International Land Port Area.
The delegation said that Xinjiang has made remarkable achievements in accelerating the construction of the core area of the Silk Road Economic Belt under the Belt and Road Initiative, and they hope to deepen exchanges and cooperation between Islamic countries and Xinjiang in fields such as economy and science and technology, Xu noted.

"China actively publishing, sharing accurate COVID-related data with world","

It takes time to generate COVID-19 data amid caseload surge: epidemiologist
China has conducted multiple technological exchanges with the World Health Organization (WHO), and will continue to support the organization in the global effort to combat COVID-19, the head of China's National Health Commission (NHC) told the head of the WHO over the phone on Saturday, as China on the same day published its data of in-hospital COVID-19 deaths after optimizing the country's COVID-19 response last month.
As data is the pillar of China's COVID-19 response, there is no reason for the country to hide or deliberately under-report such data, said Chinese epidemiologists. They explained it takes time to generate accurate data, and the government is racing against time in its efforts to provide the public with the accurate data, and this reflects its responsible attitude toward public health.
Ma Xiaowei, head of China's NHC, talked over the phonewith WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Saturday, exchanging views on the current COVID-19 prevention and control measures.
Ma said that China had shared information with the WHO and other countries since the beginning of the epidemic, was the first to identify the pathogen and share its genetic sequence, and established a mechanism for technical exchanges with the WHO.
Since China took the initiative to optimize and adjust its own epidemic prevention and control policies in light of the current situation, the two sides have conducted many technical exchanges, Ma said, adding that China will continue to support the WHO in the fight against COVID-19.
Tedros expressed appreciation for China's efforts to maintain long-term technical exchanges and share epidemic information and data with the WHO. ""WHO appreciates this meeting, as well as the public release of information on the overall situation,"" the Geneva-based agency said in a statement.
""Chinese officials provided information to WHO and in a press conference on a range of topics, including outpatient clinics, hospitalizations, patients requiring emergency treatment and critical care, and hospital deaths related to COVID-19 infection,"" the statement continued.
China and the WHO have been in close contact since Chinese health authorities last month optimized its COVID-19 response. Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Thursday that China and the international organization held five technical exchanges in the past month.
Recently, the WHO has repeatedly called for China to share more data on its COVID-19 situation to better understand the transmission dynamics of the virus on the ground.
An expert close to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Chinese CDC), who declined to be named, told the Global Times on Sunday that China has always closely monitored its COVID-19 situation, including COVID-related deaths and the emergence of new variants.
After China downgraded its management of COVID-19 from Class A to Class B, the Chinese CDC's information network continued to serve as the main pillar of the whole monitoring system, supported by reports and surveillance data from hospitals, key organizations and key groups, the expert revealed.
The expert said that after China optimized its COVID-19 control, cases began to pile up, thus it is hard to obtain an accurate grasp of the death rate during peak infections. Such assessment can be made only after the infection ebbs away, and the current stage should focus on preventing severe and fatal cases.
Liang Wannian, head of China's COVID-19 response expert panel under the NHC, said on Wednesdaythat rather than focusing on the death toll in China caused by COVID-19, the priority for the world is to get through the impact of the pandemic. He noted that calculating the specific number of deaths caused by COVID-19 is unfeasible for most countries and regions.

Honest, responsible data
On Saturday, Jiao Yahui, an NHC official, said that a total of 59,938 COVID-related deaths in hospitalswere reported between December 8, 2022 and January 12, 2023.
In an interview with the Global Times on Tuesday, an expert close to the WHO said that there were concerns over the definition of death caused by COVID-19 within that organization, and he revealed that China and the WHO are trying to reconcile this issue and they are working on it.
China has insisted on classifying deaths of patients with a positive nucleic acid test as COVID-19-related deaths, which is in line with the WHO and international standards, Jiao said on Saturday. She clarified that the causes of COVID-19 deaths are twofold: coronavirus infection leading to respiratory failure and death, or underlying diseases interacting with the coronavirus leading to death, Jiao said.
The US Centers for Disease Control noted that deaths are reported as coronavirus disease deaths ""when coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 are reported as a cause that contributed to death on the death certificate.""
Jiao also said that both the number of infections and figures of severe cases had already reached a tapering point. The number of severe COVID-19 cases reached a peak on January 5, standing at 128,000, according to Jiao, who also noted that the number was down to 105,000 as of January 12 and that 75.3 percent of beds for severe cases were occupied.
The number of visits to China's fever clinics peaked on December 23, 2022, the NHC announced on Saturday. The number totaled 2.87 million that day, according to Jiao.
However, some foreign media still questioned the data released on Saturday, saying that it is underreporting as the data was confined within only hospitals.
The expert close to the Chinese CDC said that China is also getting to grips with the number of COVID-related deaths beyond hospitals, but due to lack of testing or delayed reporting, the calculation may take longer than those compiled by hospitals.
Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese CDC, said last week that right after the pandemic broke out in 2020, the center has continued to analyze excess mortality (which was defined by WHO as the difference in the total number of deaths in a crisis compared to those anticipated under normal conditions], and published the results.
He noted that the center is also doing research on excess mortality linked to China's recent exit wave, and will provide information to the public later.
""Data is the pillar that supports our COVID-19 response. China has never stopped or deliberately hidden COVID-19 information from public, [and] the country with vast population needs time and massive, complicated calculations to generate accurate numbers, which shows the government's responsible attitude,"" said the above-quoted anonymous expert.

On Monday, Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Health Anutin Charnvirakul and other Thai government officials greeted passengers from China at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport and presented them with gifts and garlands.
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said in a speech earlier this month that the presence of Chinese tourists is vital to the country's tourism and economic growth, adding that Cambodia will not follow some other nations in imposing COVID-19 related restrictions on people arriving from China.
The Foreign Ministry of the Maldives said in a statement published on its website on Dec 28 that the country welcomes China's refinement of its exit and entry measures and ""is eagerly awaiting to welcome back Chinese tourists to the Maldives"".
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a news briefing earlier that friendly countries with hospitable hosts fill Chinese tourists' hearts with warmth and happiness and will naturally become favored destinations. He also said efforts will be made to make it easier for Chinese tourists to travel to those places, including by increasing the number of direct flights.

"Interview: Japan's unilateral radioactive wastewater discharge irresponsible, harmful: green activist","SEOUL, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- Japan's unilateral push to discharge radioactive wastewater from its crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean is irresponsible and harmful, as the Japanese government pursued it without consultations with neighboring countries, a South Korean green activist said.
""It is very concerned that Japan is still unilaterally pushing for the discharge of the Fukushima contaminated water,"" Ahn Jae-hun, energy and climate change director at the Korea Federation for Environment Movement, told Xinhua on Saturday.
""Neighboring countries such as (South) Korea and China could suffer more direct damage, so Japan had to consult with them. The problem is that Japan follows its own process (without consultations),"" said Ahn.
""A sizeable amount of the contaminated water, such as tritium, is difficult to purify no matter how much purification is performed. It is very irresponsible to release it as it is.""
Japan's planned release of tritium-laced wastewater from the Fukushima power plant into the sea will start around this spring or summer, according to Kyodo News reports citing the Japanese government.
Japan decided in April 2021 to start dumping about 1.25 million tons of nuclear wastewater into the ocean spanning 30 years from 2023.
The Japanese government has claimed that the contaminated water could be diluted with water and discharged at a low concentration after being treated with an advanced liquid processing system (ALPS).
The green activist, however, noted that the radioactive substances cannot be completely filtered through the ALPS, saying substances, such as tritium, will be poured into the sea unfiltered.
""A lot of radioactive materials have already flowed into the sea after the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Because of that, fish contaminated with cesium are caught in waters off Fukushima,"" said Ahn.
According to the South Korean environmental group's analysis of the 2021 data from Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, cesium was detected from 8 percent of Japanese fishery products.
""Once (the contaminated water) is thrown into the sea, it cannot be retrieved. Environmental effects from radioactive materials cannot be felt immediately, but will inevitably appear over a long period of time,"" Ahn said.
""The Pacific Ocean is not the sea of Japan, but the sea of everybody ... Pollutants will flow to neighboring countries in a situation that a lot of radioactive materials have already been released and contaminated (the marine ecosystem),"" said the green activist.
The South Korean government, which has opposed the radioactive wastewater dumping by Japan, reiterated its opposition.
""Putting top priority on public health and safety, the government will continue to respond by maintaining its position that the contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant should be safely disposed of in accordance with international standards from the objective and scientific perspectives,"" a South Korean foreign ministry official said Friday.

"Easy access to gun, violent media increase risk of child becoming shooter in U.S.: scholars","SYDNEY, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- Children in the United States are being influenced by gun violence depicted in media and easy access to firearms in their homes, which explained the tragedy of a first-grader shooting his teacher in Virginia, according to an analysis published Thursday.
In an article released by the media network the Conversation, Brad Bushman, professor from the Ohio State University, and Dan Romer, research director from the University of Pennsylvania, elaborated on the factors regarding how a child in the United States becomes a shooter, after a 6-year-old boy shot a teacher at Richneck Elementary School in Virginia last week.
The scholars said acts of gun violence in PG-13 movies have nearly tripled in the 30 years since the rating was introduced in 1984, while another 2019 survey of adults further showed that 12 percent said they were allowed to watch PG-13 movies between the ages of six and nine, with 6 percent saying they watched such films at an even younger age.
Violent media can lead children to engage in more dangerous behavior if they find a real gun and desensitize or numb children to violence, increasing the possibility of them imitating the aggressive behaviors they watch and considering such behavior as normal, they warned.
Besides, they also noted that the United States has far more civilian-owned guns per capita than any other country in the world, with 120.5 guns per 100 residents.
Children are naturally curious, and adults often underestimate their ability to find guns hidden in the home, the scholars said.
As every year more than 300 people in the United States are either wounded or killed in unintentional shootings by children, Bushman and Romer urged gun owners to lock away firearms, unloaded and with ammunition stored separately, especially if there are children at home.

Uncertainties linger on amid energy transformation -- a global energy outlook in 2023,"BEIJING, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- In 2022, an energy crisis hit Europe, causing fuel shortages, business closures and economic slowdowns. The impacted countries were prompted to adjust domestic energy policy, and the world is feeling the spillover.
Energy uncertainty will remain into 2023, given ongoing geopolitical conflicts, global warming and exchange rate volatility. Moreover, the international energy landscape could be profoundly reshaped.
CHAIN REACTION
""The world is in the midst of its first global energy crisis -- a shock of unprecedented breadth and complexity,"" the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its World Energy Outlook 2022 published in October. Due to tightened supplies, international energy prices have been highly volatile since last year.
As the Ukrainian crisis escalated last year, the West imposed harsh sanctions on Russia, a major energy producer and exporter, disrupting energy supplies and pushing up prices.
In European countries, wholesale prices for electricity and gas have risen five to 15-fold since early 2021, the Brussels-based economic think tank Bruegel said in a report, noting that if governments were to fully cover the cost of price increases for electricity and gas before markets find a new equilibrium at lower prices, it would cost about 1 trillion euros (1.07 trillion U.S. dollars).
""The capacity of government budgets to soften the impact on consumers is limited by the magnitude of existing debt and the volume of the price increases,"" said the report published in September.
The crisis has spotlit fragile global supply chains. Due to the sharp decline in gas via pipelines from Russia, European countries have increased liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports but do not have sufficient LNG storage facilities.
Europe's dependence on Russian energy will likely remain for a while. In 2021, the European Union imported more than 40 percent of its total gas consumption from Russia, 27 percent of its oil and 46 percent of its coal.
Beyond Europe, a worldwide chain reaction is underway. Coal imports into India hit a record high. Economies such as Japan and South Korea are considering a return to nuclear power. Emerging and less developed economies relying on imported energy have had to compete with developed economies for energy at high prices. Meanwhile, U.S. energy exporters have gained huge profits, and regions with high natural gas reserves, such as North Africa, are trying to increase exports.
Also a result of the crisis, commodity price volatility increased, with many countries experiencing high inflation.
ENERGY PRICES TO STAY HIGH
Unless geopolitics and global supply and demand fundamentally change, energy prices will remain high in the short run with tightened supply.
In 2023, the EU's potential gas supply-demand gap could reach 27 billion cubic meters, Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, said in December when presenting a report titled ""How to avoid gas shortages in the European Union in 2023."" The shortfall represents about 6.8 percent of the EU's 2023 natural gas baseline demand.
In its Oil Market Report in December, the IEA forecasted that the third quarter of 2023 would see a sharp deficit in crude oil. ""As we move through the winter months and towards a tighter oil balance"" in the third quarter of 2023, ""another price rally cannot be ruled out,"" it said.
Energy prices are projected to decline 11 percent in 2023 and a further 12 percent in 2024 but will remain more than 50 percent above their five-year average through 2024, the World Bank said in its Commodity Markets Outlook in October.
""Persistently high energy prices will continue to have inflationary implications, particularly through second-round effects such as higher transport and electricity costs for businesses,"" it said.
Though natural gas, coal and crude oil prices are expected to lower in 2023 on average, European gas and power markets may be even tighter in 2023, S&P Global Commodity Insights said in its 2023 energy outlook.
""With natural gas prices expected to remain elevated, structural reform of Europe's electricity markets to weaken the link between gas and power prices is high on the agenda for 2023, although there will be significant challenges to achieving such measures,"" it said.
In the coming years, global energy supplies will be more unstable, with frequent mild shortages, possibly restricted Russian oil and gas production and exports, a rising share of renewables and a low willingness to invest in fossil fuels due to carbon peaking and carbon neutrality.
High energy costs may drive energy-intensive businesses in many European countries to cut, shut down or shift production. ""If energy prices remain as high as they are at present in the long term, this could lead to some industries leaving Germany,"" said Oliver Falck, director of the ifo Center for Industrial Organization and New Technologies in Germany.
UNCERTAIN ENERGY TRANSITION
Experts said surging prices would force Europe to speed up its energy transition and turn to more green energy, which may not remedy the pressing crisis.
As part of its REPowerEU plan launched in March, the EU announced in May an additional investment of 210 billion euros before 2027 toward its green transition, including diversification of energy supplies and an accelerated roll-out of renewable energy to replace fossil fuels.
It also proposed increasing its binding energy efficiency target from 9 percent to 13 percent and its targeted percentage of renewable energy sources in the EU's overall energy mix from 40 percent to 45 percent by 2030.
The global energy crisis is driving ""a sharp acceleration"" in installations of renewable power, with total capacity growth worldwide set to almost double in 2022-2027 and wind and solar to account for over 90 percent of the renewable power capacity added over the next five years.
""This is a clear example of how the current energy crisis can be a historic turning point towards a cleaner and more secure energy system,"" said Birol, IEA executive director.
Although hikes in energy prices may speed up the transition to renewables to some degree, some experts worry that the current crisis might prompt certain countries to rely more on traditional energy instead of less.
In 2023, most countries will develop both traditional and new energy to tackle the energy shock, The Economist said in November. ""In the short term they will embrace investment in polluting fossil fuels in return for security,"" it said. ""In the long term they will adopt state-led industrial policy in an attempt to accelerate a renewables build-out.""

BEIRUT, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- Hezbollah's leader on Tuesday accused the United States of preventing Lebanon from taking free fuel from Iran even as his country suffers from power outages.
""Iran's fuel offer is still existing, but the U.S. has been preventing Lebanon from accepting it,"" Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised speech.
Nasrallah called on Hezbollah's rivals supported by the United States in Lebanon to obtain a sanctions waiver from Washington.
""We have an opportunity to solve the fuel crisis, and you, America's allies, must benefit from your relationship with the U.S. to bring an exception for Lebanon to receive the Iranian fuel,"" Nasrallah said.
According to Nasrallah, Lebanon's access to Iranian fuel would allow the country to secure four hours of power supply on a daily basis for six months to help solve the electricity crisis in the country.
Hezbollah is a Lebanese armed group and political party backed by Iran.
In September 2022, Iran said it was prepared to provide Lebanon with 660,000 tonnes of gasoline as a ""gift"" to ease electricity cuts in the crisis-hit country. However, the United States later warned that Lebanon might be subject to U.S. sanctions if it imports Iranian oil.
Lebanon has suffered for decades from power outages. Its economic collapse since 2019 has burdened the state's treasury, slowing down fuel imports to maintain the operation of the remaining power plants.

NEW YORK, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- The COVID-19 pandemic is tied to a surge in childhood injuries and deaths due to firearms in the United States, a study conducted at one St. Louis hospital has found.
Black children and those in low-income households were at greater risk, according to the University of Missouri-led study.

"High consumption, past policies, U.S. sanctions lead to Iran's gas shortage","TEHRAN, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- High domestic consumption, ineffective policies of the past and the U.S. sanctions are among the factors behind the recent gas shortage in Iran that led to nationwide closures over the previous days, according to Iranian analysts and media.
Iran, which has the second-largest gas reserves in the world behind Russia, has experienced a gas shortage since the start of the winter.
While most Iranian provinces had sub-zero temperatures, the Iranian government had to temporarily shut down factories, companies, as well as schools and colleges in a number of cities from Saturday to Monday in order to keep people's homes warm.
HIGH CONSUMPTION
In an analysis piece, the news website Shahrara News wrote that gas consumption by the residential as well as trade and industrial sectors in Iran has surpassed 700 million cubic meters (mcm) per day this winter, indicating a 150-mcm increase year on year.
It said the figure is 6.7 times higher than the global per capita and three times more than that of the entire consumption by the European Union states.
According to the Iranian Oil Ministry, the country's current daily gas production stands at close to 1 billion cubic meters, of which only 850 mcm remain after the separation of gas condensate.
Iran's daily gas consumption reaches between 650 mcm and 750 mcm during winter, leading to an imbalance of 200 mcm in the gas network, according to the analysis.
In a separate analysis of the country's energy status quo, the news website Didban Iran wrote that statistics hint at an absence of principled energy production and consumption planning in Iran in the previous years, also blaming ""bad consumption"" as one of the main reasons for the current energy shortage.
INEFFECTIVE POLICIES OF PAST
Experts said that some ineffective policies implemented in the past were one of the reasons.
Morteza Behrouzifar, an energy expert, told Iranian Students' News Agency (ISNA) that during the past years, diversifying the energy basket has not received due attention in Iran, and fuel storage has also been almost neglected likewise.
During the 1980s, Iran decided to use gas as the main fuel for domestic consumption as the country had abundant gas reserves and did not seek to export them, the expert noted.
The majority of the industries developed in Iran during those years and the following years required big amounts of energy to run, said Behrouzifar, adding the policy seemed quite logical until the time arrived when the country failed to optimize domestic energy consumption and increase production proportionately.
Speaking to ISNA, another energy expert Mehdi Hasehmzadeh also hinted at insufficient attention to gas storage in the past years, regretting that two Iranian companies involved in the field of gas storage were dissolved in 2016, and no other company is currently active in the area.
Between 2005 and 2013, the Iranian government increased the number of the cities and villages connected to the nationwide gas network from 600 to 1,000 and from 2,080 to over 14,000 respectively, Khabar Online news agency wrote in another analysis.
During the same period, the then-Iranian government increased the number of industrial units using natural gas as feedstock from 9,500 to 58,000. However, paying insufficient attention to using other energies for development is one of the main reasons for the current gas shortage.
SANCTIONS SHARE
In their analyses of the country's current circumstances, a lot of Iranian media blamed the U.S. sanctions, reimposed on Iran's oil and banking sector following Washington's withdrawal from a 2015 nuclear deal in May 2018, as the main culprit for the current imbalance in the gas sector.
Khabar Online wrote that Iran needs 160 billion U.S. dollars in investments to renovate its oil wells, which have deteriorated and sustained damage over the past few years.
The U.S. sanctions have impeded both the flow of foreign funds and the transfer of technology to Iran, which needs to import modern technologies to boost its gas production, according to Khabar Online.
Behrouzifar said the lifting of U.S. sanctions is a long-term cure for Iran's domestic gas industry.
The U.S. sanctions not only have affected Iran's gas production capacity but also its gas distribution infrastructure, Didban Iran quoted Ali Jabal-Ameli, a financial market expert, as saying.

""China hopes that all parties concerned will exercise rationality and restraint, engage in dialogue, and commit themselves to resolving common security concerns by political means,"" he said.
""The international community should focus on promoting peace talks, encouraging Russia and Ukraine to return to negotiations, and accumulating conditions of an early ceasefire and cessation of hostilities,"" he added.
""Any incitement of hatred and inflammation of tensions should be rejected. In this process, religion should become a positive force in advocating peace and promoting unity, and build peace in the minds of the local people,"" said Dai.
Turning to religious issues in conflict situations, the envoy said that ""we have seen that in some conflict areas, religious issues, if not handled properly, tend to intensify conflicts, and are not conducive to resolving hatred and achieving reconciliation.""
""China has always maintained that the freedom of religion and belief should be fully protected and respected, and that exchanges between religions and sects should be strengthened, mutual respect fostered, and the peace of culture advocated, so as to inject positive energy into the political settlement of hot spot issues,"" the envoy noted.

The silence of politicians around stronger gun laws suggests this latest round of gunfire in a classroom will not lead to real preventive measures.
NEW YORK, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- The vast and unchecked personal arsenals of guns in the United States have given Americans a shameful distinction: it is the only developed nation that now teaches its kindergartners how to wait in line for the bathroom and hide under desks for a mass shooting, said an article published by The Atlantic-Journal Constitution on Monday.
School shootings climbed to the highest number in two decades in 2020-2021, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. In 2020, guns became the leading cause of death among children, adolescents and teens, surpassing car crashes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
""When will the shock of gunshots in school be enough to inspire the action necessary to prevent guns in schools and the shattering of lives it causes?"" asked Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, after a school shooting in Virginian earlier this month.

EU leaders and industries have voiced their concerns over the IRA, which contains provisions that could have significant repercussions on the competitiveness and investment decisions of the EU industry, in particular as regards sectors crucial for its transition to a green economy.
BRUSSELS, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the European Union (EU) on Tuesday vowed to take measures to protect the competitiveness of the bloc's member states from the United States' Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) while trying to avoid falling into a subsidy war with Washington.
The EU member states' economy and finance ministers discussed the matter on the margins of the year's first Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin).
European Commissioner for Economy Paolo Gentiloni underlined the need to address the effects of the IRA on the EU's already strained economy but warned against a subsidy war.

""We have to strengthen our competitiveness ... It's not about a subsidy war with other countries or U.S., it's about strengthening Europe's competitiveness,"" he said ahead of the meeting.
The EU has to work on streamlining its state aid rules, according to Gentiloni, especially for sectors that are crucial for clean technologies and innovation. In parallel, the bloc should be funding common projects, he said, as these will strengthen its competitiveness without undermining its internal market.

Signed in mid-August last year, the IRA targets a record 369 billion U.S. dollars of spending on climate and energy provisions. The landmark package comprises tax credits for electric cars made in North America and supports U.S. battery supply chains.
Since then, a joint high-level task force has been established to address the EU's request to be treated ""fairly,"" like other U.S. trade partners, such as Canada or Mexico.
Sweden's Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson said on Tuesday after a meeting with fellow ministers from the EU that the member states will continue to discuss their response to measures the United States has taken to stimulate green technology investments, which are seen to disadvantage European companies.

Later the same day, European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis was meeting U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai to discuss the matter.
""We're working through the task force, but we're also doing outreach at other levels to address those concerns. We know that on the U.S. side there are some delays in the sense of implementing guidelines. This gives us a bit more time for discussion on some elements,"" Dombrovskis said. However, the task force is not likely to solve all the problems.
French President Emmanuel Macron has been pushing for a ""Made in Europe"" strategy, in which critical sectors would be subsidized to counter the U.S. subsidies.

IAEA completing stationing of missions at Ukraine's nuclear plants,"KIEV, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is finalizing the stationing of permanent missions at Ukrainian nuclear power plants (NPPs), the Ukrainian government press service reported Wednesday.
While speaking at a joint briefing with IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that the mission at Khmelnytsky NPP in western Ukraine is to start working in the coming days.
""Today, I heard from Director General Rafael Grossi assurances of full support from the IAEA for our efforts to ensure nuclear safety, including at the Zaporizhzhia NPP,"" Shmyhal said.
""We are working on the issue of organizing a safety zone around the Zaporizhzhia NPP, and we are making progress on this matter,"" Grossi was quoted by the Interfax-Ukraine news agency as saying.
According to an IAEA statement issued on Tuesday, the experts will monitor key nuclear safety and security systems, provide technical assistance, assess the plants' needs and report to the IAEA headquarters.
""With IAEA teams permanently present at all of Ukraine's NPPs and the Chornobyl site, the Agency will have around 11-12 staff simultaneously on the ground in the country, an unprecedented undertaking by the organization,"" the international nuclear watchdog said in the statement.

"Gunman stood over teen mom, baby before killing them at California home: U.S. media","LOS ANGELES, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- A gunman stood over a 16-year-old young mother cradling her 10-month-old baby and fired into their heads in a massacre that left six family members dead Monday in the U.S. state of California, local media reported Wednesday, citing police.
""It's shocking for the nation,"" Tulare County Sheriff Mike Boudreaux was quoted as saying by The Sacramento Bee, the largest newspaper in Sacramento, capital city of the western U.S. state. The massacre was a very specific targeted act of violence, he added.
The six were killed in an early Monday morning attack at a home in Tulare County's town of Goshen. Police officers were called to the home just before 4 a.m. local time for multiple shots fired.
Authorities have identified the victims of the execution-style killings, most of them shot in the head. The oldest victim, a 72-year-old grandmother, may have been sleeping when she was shot and killed, according to the report of The Sacramento Bee.
Boudreaux said during a news conference Tuesday that the massacre has the hallmarks of ""cartel-like executions"" and stressed that investigators are still determining whether it was gang-related or if there is a drug cartel angle, reported the newspaper.
The teen mother was found in a nearby ditch down the street from the home. Investigators believe the teen fled and was hiding when a gunman stood over her and fired into her head and the baby was also shot in the head, said the report, citing Boudreaux.
A third victim was found in the doorway of the home, and three others were found dead at multiple places on the property, the report added.
Investigators believe two people committed the massacre, and speculate that a third person was in a getaway car. Authorities are offering a reward of 10,000 U.S. dollars for help in solving the massacre.

UN wants to increase aid to frontline areas of Ukraine,"UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations said Wednesday it aims to increase convoys carrying aid to parts of Ukraine ""close to the frontlines,"" supporting local volunteers and organizations.
The UN humanitarian coordination office, OCHA, said in a press release that a seven-truck convoy had reached Vovchansk in the Kharkiv region, just five kilometers from the Russian border.
""This community has been heavily impacted by months of hostilities and the 4,500 people who remain there depend on humanitarian aid to meet their needs,"" said the release.
The convoy supplied hygiene kits, blankets, solar lamps, sleeping bags and emergency shelter kits to more than 1,000 families, provided by the UN refugee agency UNHCR, the International Organization for Migration and the UN Children's Fund.
Among the participants in the convoy was the World Food Programme, which conducted a rapid assessment of markets.
The UN-brokered Black Sea Grain Initiative signed last July along with a Memorandum of Understanding, aimed at suppling markets with food and fertilizer amid global shortages and rising prices exacerbated by the Ukraine crisis, has now allowed 17.8 million tons to reach millions in need worldwide.
The critical food supplies, mostly from farms in Ukraine, have reached 43 countries since August, more than 40 percent of them low and middle-income nations, the initiative's Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) said in a note to correspondents on Wednesday.
In December, exports through Ukraine's Black Sea ports rose to 3.7 million metric tons, up from 2.6 million in November, and over the last two weeks, nearly 1.2 million metric tons have left port.
Nearly 44 percent of the wheat exported has been shipped to low and lower-middle income countries, the JCC reported.
In support of its humanitarian operations in hunger-stricken countries, the World Food Programme purchased 8 percent of wheat exported last year.
The JCC team, which includes officials from the United Nations, Russia, TÃ¼rkiye and Ukraine, has enabled over 1,300 voyages so far.
To reduce the backlog and improve operational efficiency within the JCC, the United Nations encourages all parties to remove obstacles.
Additionally, the initiative calls for the facilitation of safe navigation for fertilizer exports, including ammonia.

U.S. police arrest failed candidate in shootings at Democrats: media,"NEW YORK, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- Police have arrested a 39-year-old man who lost a bid for the New Mexico statehouse as a Republican and later paid for four men to shoot at Democratic lawmakers' homes in recent months, U.S. media reported.
The case against Solomon Pe a, who had posted photos of himself online with Donald Trump campaign material, is one of dozens across the United States where people have threatened, and in some cases attempted to carry out, violence against members of Congress, school board members and other election officials, the Associated Press reported Tuesday.
Officials accuse Pe a of paying 500 U.S. dollars to four men to shoot at the homes of Democratic lawmakers. He went along for the final drive-by, his gun jamming as bullets ripped into the bedroom of a 10-year-old girl who was asleep, police were quoted as saying.
The criminal complaint against Pe a describes how anger over his landslide defeat in November led to attacks at the homes of four Democratic lawmakers in New Mexico's largest city. A SWAT team arrested him Monday afternoon, police said.
According to the report, Pe a spent nine years behind bars after his arrest in April 2007 for stealing electronics and other goods from several retail stores. He was released in March 2016 and had his voting rights restored after completing five years probation in April 2021.

NEW YORK, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- In his closing remarks before a vote on a sweeping firearms ban, U.S. Illinois Senate President Don Harmon pushed back at critics who contended the prohibitions would violate the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
The Oak Park Democrat concluded with a message for Republican lawmakers and other opponents of the measure, which was passed in response to the deadly mass shooting at Highland Park's Fourth of July parade: ""We'll see you in court.""
When Democratic Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the measure into law on Tuesday after the Democratic-controlled House gave its approval, Illinois became the ninth U.S. state to ban so-called assault weapons, winning praise from President Joe Biden.
""It also set up inevitable legal challenges from gun rights advocates that could take years for the courts to resolve,"" said the Chicago Tribune in its latest report of the development.
In a letter to Pritzker, Harmon and House Speaker Emanuel ""Chris"" Welch of Hillside, Richard Pearson, executive director of the Illinois State Rifle Association, responded directly to the Senate president's remarks, writing: ""Challenge accepted.""

The analysis revealed that at least 90 California law enforcement agencies have spent more than 20 million dollars buying firearms, ammunition and other gear from at least six federally licensed firearms dealers with a history of violating firearms laws, reported news portal The Intercept on Tuesday.
The violations included failing to report sales involving multiple weapons, a key indicator for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) in identifying straw purchasers and potential firearms trafficking.
""Using taxpayer money to buy guns from dealers with a history of noncompliance with gun safety laws is counterproductive, to say the least,"" Erica Rice, program manager for Brady's Combating Crime Guns Initiative, was quoted as saying.

UN farm fund warns of worsening global food crisis,"DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- The head of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) warned at the World Economic Forum (WEF) here on Wednesday that the ongoing food crisis is likely to continue this year.
""For 2023, we're not expecting a better situation than for 2022. Some of the shortcomings in the global supply chains that we have seen in 2022 will have an impact in 2023,"" IFAD President Alvaro Lario told Xinhua.
""We are working with many of our partners in seeing how to also unlock the fertilizer situation. However, for 2023 given the planting season in 2022, there will be not much of good news,"" he said.
GROWING HUNGER
The president said that although action is being taken to address the food crisis, it is barely enough and more investments will be needed.
""We're seeing many of the smallholders suffer because of the cost-of-living crisis, the limited access to food and fertilizers. Unfortunately, the planting season has been lost,"" he said.
""However, there are several ongoing initiatives on how to address the shortcomings of food systems. Some of them relate to taxation, subsidies, distribution and production. We're looking into ways to increase in a massive way the investments that go into food systems,"" he said.
According to IFAD, three-quarters of the poorest people in the world live in the rural areas of developing countries. Most of them depend on agriculture for their livelihood.
Climate change, a growing global population, and volatile food and energy prices have the potential to push millions more vulnerable people into extreme poverty and hunger by 2030.
According to the ""State of Food Security and Nutrition"" report published by five UN agencies, including IFAD, last July, the world is falling further behind in efforts to end hunger and poverty in line with the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
It showed that the number of people affected by hunger globally rose to 828 million in 2021, an increase of about 150 million since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
CHINA'S ROLE
Lario also said that China could serve as an example of how to eradicate absolute poverty. ""China is a big partner for us at IFAD,"" he said.
As both a borrowing and a donor country, China has played ""a fundamental role"" in the south-south triangular cooperation, said the IFAD chief.
South-South cooperation refers to development cooperation between developing countries in the Global South. When such cooperation involves support from a Northern partner, it is referred to as Triangular cooperation.
""Given what China has experienced over the last decades, they are really a good example of how to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. We still work with China on rural poverty, and they have been a fundamental actor for us,"" said Lario.
In 2021, China announced a ""complete victory"" in its fight against poverty, which means absolute poverty has been eradicated in the world's most populous country.

But the cost-of-living crisis will continue to be a very real problem for both households and businesses, as price pressures remain high in the short term, Paleja added.

""Inflation remains particularly high for low-income families, who are on the wrong side of a large cost-of-living gap due to the high cost of energy and food,"" said Jack Leslie, senior economist at the think tank Resolution Foundation.
An analysis conducted by the Resolution Foundation showed that the poorest tenth of UK families experienced an inflation rate of 11.9 percent compared to only 9.2 percent for the richest tenth.
The falling inflation rate will also come as a relief to the Bank of England, whose policymakers may see this as an opportunity to slow the pace of further interest rate rises, Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said.
""With the effects of past rate rises still passing through the UK economy, we could see the base interest rate peak at 4 percent in the first quarter of the year,"" he said.

EdSurge Research has spent the last year gathering stories from Asian American K-12 educators working during a time when violence against Asian Americans was at an all-time high.
""By and large, the 80 Asian American K-12 educators we interviewed cited these incidents, and the silence of their colleagues and school leaders, as deeply frustrating and traumatizing for them,"" said the report.
""For many, it brought up long-repressed experiences with racism,"" it noted. ""They had to take on the emotional labor of explaining how microaggressions, insensitive comments and non-responses were racist.""
They had to decide whether it was worth the risk to their jobs and their mental energy to talk about racism in the news, to call out interpersonal racism or to suppress their emotions for the sake of everyone else, it said.
""Finally, many teachers took on programming, curriculum development and professional development by themselves. This was an additional tax to their mental health,"" it added.

Australian general practice system in worst state in 40 years: health minister,"CANBERRA, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Health Minister Mark Butler has flagged a major overhaul of the country's universal health care scheme.
Butler recently said that general practice in Australia is in the worst shape since the introduction of Medicare in 1984 as an aging population increases pressure on the health system.
Along with medical and patient groups, Butler has undertaken a review of Medicare which will be published within weeks.
General practitioners (GPs) have warned that a lack of government support has forced them to close practices or charge more, with current Medicare rebates not sufficient to cover the cost of seeing patients.
Butler said there were also structural issues with the Medicare system such as poor digital connections between primary health, hospitals and aged and disability care facilities.
""Frankly, I think our general practice system right now is in the worst shape it has been in, in the 40-year history of Medicare,"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on Tuesday.
""We're seeing it across the developed world. But there are particular challenges here in Australia that we are determined as a new government to fix.""
Butler, who wants GPs to be able to work closely with nurses, pharmacists and other health professionals, said federal, state and territory governments would have to work closely with the sector to fix Medicare.

"Chinese Lunar New Year celebrated in Serbia with grand gala, fireworks","BELGRADE, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- With fireworks, lion dance, and a festival of tastes, Serbians and overseas Chinese welcomed the Chinese Lunar New Year in Belgrade on Saturday.
The central celebration welcoming the Year of the Rabbit held at the Kalemegdan Fortress in Belgrade gathered several hundreds of people, including Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic and the Chinese Ambassador to Serbia Chen Bo, who were all entertained by lion dancers who just flew here from China.
""We are (the Lion Dance team) from the Dong Fang Wu Shu School in Dongming County, Shandong Province, and we came to Serbia to show our traditional Chinese culture and bring a lot of flavors of the Chinese New Year to Serbia,"" Yang Zhengqiang, one of the lion dancers told Xinhua.
At the beginning of the celebration, Brnabic said that the New Year celebrations across the country display the love of the Serbian people towards the Chinese.
""On behalf of our people I wish you (China and Chinese people) good health, luck, and many new economic achievements,"" she said, pledging to further strengthen the ""iron-clad friendship"" between China and Serbia.
She thanked China's support to Serbia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the selfless support and assistance amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Chen said that this traditional cultural manifestation is the embodiment of the ""iron-clad friendship"" between the two peoples, who, although geographically far away, are getting closer.

"Global economy facing ""turning point"" amid challenges","

DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- The global economy has regained steam after a difficult COVID-19 pandemic, but experts at the World Economic Forum (WEF) say a recovery is far from certain.
Under the theme ""Cooperation in a Fragmented World,"" the WEF's 2023 annual meeting concluded here on Friday. The gathering came amid unprecedented global challenges such as high inflation, an energy crisis, climate change and geopolitical conflict.
Growth is on an upward trajectory and could witness a more robust recovery in 2023 through global cooperation and following China's adjusted COVID-19 response measures.

CAUTION STILL NEEDED
The global economic outlook is not as bad as feared a couple of months ago, ""but less bad doesn't quite yet mean good,"" Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), told a closing panel at the WEF. ""We have to be cautious.""
Georgieva said headline inflation was heading down. China's optimized COVID-19 response is expected to boost global growth, with the IMF forecasting the Chinese economy will reach an estimated 4.4 percent, far outpacing global growth.
Signs of declining inflation, resilient consumer spending and strong labor markets, among others, suggest that growth could rebound in the short term.
""Be careful not to get on the other side of the spectrum, from being too pessimistic to being too optimistic. Stay in the middle of realism that seems to serve the world well,"" Georgieva said.
The WEF issued its Global Risks Report 2023, saying that conflict and geo-economic tensions have triggered a series of deeply interconnected global risks, with the cost of living crisis being the most significant short-term risk. At the same time, climate change and climate adaptation are the most considerable long-term concern.
Georgieva said that future growth prospects depend on how supply chain security is managed.
""If we diversify rationally, the cost of this adjustment would be low -- we put it down to 0.2 percent of GDP. If we trash trade that has been an engine for growth for so many decades, the cost can go up to 7 percent loss of GDP, equaling 7 trillion U.S. dollars,"" she said.
""Labor markets are holding firm so far, but interest rates are yet to bite, and if they bite more severely, then we can see unemployment going up. And it is very different for a consumer to have a cost of living crisis and a job than the cost of living crisis and no job,"" Georgieva said.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde was also cautious about the global economic outlook.
""The greatest tragedy in this moment would be if central banks were to lurch away from a focus on assuring price stability prematurely, and we were to have to fight this battle twice,"" said former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers.
Despite recent signs of improvement, ""relief must not become complacency,"" Summers noted.

COOPERATION BRINGS OPTIMISM
Attendees at the forum said cooperation would be for global growth. WEF President Borge Brende expressed confidence that ""we can shape a more resilient, sustainable and equitable future,"" but ""the only way to do it is together.""
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for urgent action on several interconnected challenges, including the global economic crisis and climate. He underlined the need to ""forge the pathways to cooperation in our fragmented world.""
Leslie Maasdorp, vice president and chief financial officer of the New Development Bank, told Xinhua, ""Without multilateral cooperation, you cannot really deal with challenges that are cross-national ... I believe that the one positive lesson we can learn from COVID is that we are interconnected.""
Though challenges still threaten the global economy, attendees voiced hope that a severe recession may be avoided.
""We are now heading to a year where hopefully the corporates, the consumers, the state, policymakers will continue to have that resilient, determined approach to engineer the transitions that must take place,"" Lagarde said.
""The situation around the world must be improving a little bit,"" said Lagarde. ""Players are moving from defense mode, that they had effectively been in 2021 and 2022, towards a more competitive mode.""
In his closing remarks on Friday, Brende said despite the many complex issues facing the global community, progress had been made at the annual meeting, especially in tackling the most urgent crises of food, energy and climate.
""For me, the greatest lesson of the week has been that although the world is more fragmented today, it does not need to be tomorrow,"" Brende said.
EXPECTATIONS FOR CHINA
Business leaders worldwide have been pessimistic about the global economy in recent months, but now, cautious optimism is emerging. They are confident about the robust growth of the Chinese economy and expect China to be a ""key driver"" of a global recovery.

China's economy posted steady growth in 2022 despite pressures including COVID-19 breakouts and a complex external environment, with its gross domestic product growing 3 percent year on year to a record high of 121.0207 trillion yuan (about 17.95 trillion U.S. dollars) in 2022, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed.
The 2022 GDP growth was published at the time when the WEF was underway. With the better-than-expected data, optimism over both the Chinese and global economies spread in Davos.
Maasdorp was confident in China's expected growth, a sentiment shared across the banking sector. Although he predicted a ""bumpy period"" in the first quarter of this year and potentially in the second, there are strong expectations for more robust growth driven by consumption in the year's second half.
Haitham Al Ghais, secretary general of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, praised China for factoring renewable energy into its growth strategy.
""We are extremely proud of the steps taken by the Chinese government to promote renewable energy as a part of the energy mix as required for China to fuel its continuous development and economic growth,"" he said.
""We are very confident in the Chinese economy and the strength of the leadership and the government and the people of China,"" Al Ghais said.

Experts stress importance of global biodiversity targets in Davos,"DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- Experts have underscored the importance of meeting the goals and targets of a landmark biodiversity agreement on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting 2023.
""A truly historical, ground-breaking, and landmark agreement,"" said Jane Nelson, director of the Corporate Responsibility Initiative at Harvard Kennedy School, on Thursday of the recent UN biodiversity deal.
Under the leadership of China, the deal, entitled Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, was adopted at the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity last month, setting four long-term goals for 2050 and 23 global targets over the decade to 2030 for preserving nature.
According to the targets set by the framework, by 2030, at least 30 percent of degraded terrestrial, inland water and coastal and marine ecosystems will be under effective restoration.
""When one considers that an estimated only 17 percent of lands and less than 8 percent of marine areas are currently protected, this is an ambitious goal, but it's doable,"" she said.
There were plenty of discussions during the Davos week concerning how a company can achieve net-zero emissions and become nature-positive, Katell Le Goulven, executive director of the Hoffmann Global Institute for Business and Society, told Xinhua.
""It is very important because this global framework asks companies to report and disclose the risk exposure to nature and their dependency on nature,"" she stressed.
Time sensitivity is crucial, said Peter Fearnhead, chief executive officer of African Parks, a non-governmental organization focused on conservation.
Considering governance challenges in some countries, poverty levels in Africa and growing populations, the world must succeed in achieving the 2030 targets, Fearnhead said at a session of the WEF annual meeting.

Among the 32 fatalities were 28 military and 4 police personnel, including a woman police officer, said the Staff Union in a press release.
For the ninth year in a row, the mission in Mali, known by its French acronym as MINUSMA, suffered the most fatalities, with 14 deaths in 2022, followed by 13 killed from the mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
""Peacekeepers and the civilian personnel who work side by side with them are on the front lines of the United Nations' work in the world's most challenging environments,"" said Staff Union President Aitor Arauz in the press release.

"Kenya says Russia-Ukraine conflict, U.S. rate hike to dampen 2023 economic prospects","NAIROBI, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- The National Treasury of Kenya is buoyant with sustained economic growth this year, but warns that the outlook could be dampened by rising external shocks that include the Russia-Ukraine conflict and U.S. interest rate hikes.
The Treasury said while it expects the economy to grow 6.1 percent in 2023 and maintain that momentum over the medium-term, global uncertainties could impact growth.
""There is the possible worsening of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which heightens the risk of oil and commodity price volatility, elevated inflationary pressures and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" it said in a proposed Budget Policy Statement for 2023 issued on Thursday.
It added that tightening the global monetary policy, especially in the United States, could increase volatility in the financial markets, hurting the local currency.
For the first time in five years, Kenya's inflation rate, which stood at 9.1 percent in December 2022, remains above the government target of 5 percent, mainly driven by supply-side constraints occasioned by external shocks and climate-related food and energy prices.
Treasury Cabinet Secretary Njuguna Ndung'u noted in the document that as part of the country's economic turnaround plan, the government will scale up revenue collection to 3 trillion Kenyan shillings (about 24 billion U.S. dollars) in the 2023/2024 financial year and 32 billion U.S. dollars over the medium term.

Germany postpones decision on Leopard tank delivery to Ukraine,"BERLIN, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- Germany has yet to decide whether it will send German-made Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine.
""There are good reasons for the delivery, there are good reasons against it,"" the country's Minister of Defense Boris Pistorius said on Friday after meeting his U.S. and European counterparts in Ramstein, Germany.
Pistorius said that his ministry would check the country's stocks of the Leopard tank for possible delivery to Ukraine in the next few weeks. ""We are preparing for all eventualities,"" he said.
The delivery of lighter Marder infantry fighting vehicles, announced in early December 2022, has been criticized by some as inadequately prepared. According to the Ministry of Defense (BMVg), it was unclear at the time where the vehicles would come from.
Instead of Leopard tanks, Pistorius announced further deliveries of Marder and Gepard tanks as well as a Patriot surface-to-air missile system. With this, the value of Germany's military support for Ukraine is to reach 3.3 billion euros (3.6 billion U.S. dollars).
The United States, meanwhile, has increased its support to Ukraine by 2.5 billion U.S. dollars to 26.7 billion U.S. dollars. The new package includes 59 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles.
Other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), such as Poland, have reiterated their intention to supply Ukraine with Leopard tanks from their own stocks. However, this would require the approval of the manufacturing country, Germany, which has not yet decided on this matter.
Russia has repeatedly said that the supply of Western weapons to Ukraine does not help resolve the conflict but prolongs the suffering of the Ukrainian people. (1 euro = 1.08 U.S. dollar)

Leaders said that the energy crisis comes after a decade of under-investment in legacy energy sources, as well as slow investment in renewables.
DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- Energy experts at the World Economic Forum (WEF) have emphasized the importance of securing energy supply and the green transition in tackling the energy crisis and building a clean, sustainable future.
The current energy crisis is not the first for some countries, but it is the first at a truly global level, due to the interconnection of energy markets.
Soaring global prices for oil, natural gas and coal have hit consumers hard, combined with rising inflation and disruptions in supply chains at a time when the world was already recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The issue of how to achieve geopolitical stability and energy security was discussed this week at the WEF, which is currently meeting in Davos, Switzerland.
Leaders said that the energy crisis comes after a decade of under-investment in legacy energy sources, as well as slow investment in renewables.

The world ""has never seen an energy crisis of this depth and complexity,"" said Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA).
However, he underlined that the global energy emergency has boosted renewable energies, which in turn will reinforce energy security.
Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud emphasized the need for near-term stability, especially in the world's energy markets. Geopolitical stability is ""absolutely key"" to global energy security, he said.
""In the meantime, we need to maintain a supply of traditional energies that are priced in a way that ensures stability -- and we will continue to address this in a responsible way,"" Faisal said.
Energy leaders also highlighted the importance of the ""Green transition"", calling for the development of renewable energy in order to ensure supply and fight climate change.
Globalization was also emphasized as part of the green transition. Adam Tooze, director of the European Institute at Columbia University, said that ""the energy transition is effectively a set of interdependencies.""
Meanwhile, Birol said that ""the biggest driver of renewable energy growth today is energy security.""
In a recent report, the IEA said the world was at the dawn of a new industrial age of clean energy technology manufacturing, and this is creating major new markets and millions of jobs. However, it is also creating new risks, prompting countries across the globe to devise industrial strategies to secure their place in the new global energy economy.
The IEA estimates that the market for mass-produced green energy will be worth about 650 billion U.S. dollars annually by 2030, more than triple its current value.
Faisal said Saudi Arabia is ""investing almost 200 billion U.S. dollars in renewable energy at home and abroad"" as it brings online more low-carbon technologies.
Many expect key technologies, including wind, solar, batteries, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and hydrogen infrastructure, to continue growing this year as countries look for alternative energy sources.

China's efforts to push forward the development of renewable energy were underlined at the WEF this week.
IEA Chief Fatih Birol told Xinhua on the sidelines of the Forum that China has a leading role to play in green technologies.
""China today is the biggest driver of clean energy technologies,"" he said, adding that it is the global leader in solar, wind, electric cars and new nuclear facilities.
According to the report ""Energy Technology Perspectives 2023"" released by the IEA recently, China currently dominates the manufacturing and trade of most clean energy technologies, and its investment in the sector has been instrumental in bringing down costs worldwide for key technologies.

NEW YORK, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) -- Inflation led a record high 38 percent of Americans to delay medical treatment due to costs in 2022, a new Gallup poll showed.
The percentage who reported they or a family member postponed medical treatment was up from 26 percent at the end of 2021. ""It is the highest in the 22 years the polling company has surveyed the issue,"" said a Washington Times report of the annual poll, which was released on Tuesday.

"Clumsy communication, rampant political division in U.S. harm public health in COVID-19: media","LOS ANGELES, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) -- Three years of COVID-19 have shown how clumsy communication, poor coordination and rampant political division can harm public health. The need to repair these divisions is especially acute, a recent report by the American magazine Vanity Fair has said.
As COVID-19 enters its fourth year, the United States has seen more than 1 million deaths, and the highly infectious XBB.1.5 variant is contributing to rising cases. At the same time, ""the goal of eliminating pandemic threats seems as distant as ever,"" said the report published Tuesday.

Politicized topics are the ones most likely to cause Americans to question the ""recommendations of the federal health agencies,"" according to data analyzed by Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. ""COVID polarized,"" she said.
""In the U.S., our political will is flagging. Our public health workforce is exhausted and demoralized. Our deep political divisions have impacted everything from funding streams to a basic belief in science,"" said the report.

Raisi made the remark in a phone call with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, highlighting the necessity of expanding cooperation and coordination between the two countries, according to the website of the Iranian president's office.
Turning to the regional issues of common interest, the Iranian president said Tehran supports the resolution of Syria's issues through the Astana peace process, launched in January 2017 under the initiative of TÃ¼rkiye, Russia, and Iran.

PARIS, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) -- France's Ministry of the Interior said that an estimated 1.12 million French people took to the streets across the country on Thursday to protest against the government's controversial pension reform plan.
The CGT, France's largest union, estimated the nationwide protest number at 2 million. According to the ministry, in Paris alone, 80,000 demonstrators expressed their discontent.
Simultaneously, workers in several sectors staged a 24-hour strike. The rate of strikers at the French national railway company SNCF alone reached 46.3 percent, which resulted in numerous cancelations of regional and national services.
In the Ile-de France region where Paris is situated, the public transport sector reduced the frequency of metros and tramways.
On Jan. 10, French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne laid out details of the country's controversial pension reform plan, which would progressively raise the legal retirement age gradually by three months a year from 62 to 64 years by 2030 and would put in place a guaranteed minimum pension.
Borne told a press conference that starting from 2027, people will have to work 43 years to qualify for a full pension.
In 2019, demonstrations were also held in France against the pension reform, but then only 800,000 people participated, according to the Interior Ministry.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States hit its debt limit on Thursday, prompting the Treasury Department to take ""extraordinary measures"" to continue financing the federal government.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen announced in a letter to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy that her department would put the temporary brakes on new investments in a few government retirement funds, from Thursday until June 5.
Those include the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund and a couple of others.
Yellen said such moves could allow the federal government to pay its bills until June.
At the same time, Yellen said there would be ""considerable uncertainty"" around those actions, should Congress fail to pass legislation to increase the 31.4 trillion U.S. dollar debt ceiling.
According to the Government Accountability Office, U.S. lawmakers have increased the nation's debt ceiling 22 times since 1997.
Republicans, who now control the House by a slim margin, want to tie any debt-raising legislation to spending cuts. This occurs at a time when the U.S. government has spent so much that it has sparked the worst inflation in four decades.
Many economists have blasted the recently-passed omnibus bill, worth 1.7 trillion U.S. dollars, as loaded with frivolous spending.
The White House said it would not compromise on raising the debt ceiling.
Failing to increase the debt ceiling could lead to a default on U.S. debt that could unleash economic calamity worldwide.

LAGOS, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- The first phase of a China-built electric-powered light rail project in Nigeria's southwestern state of Lagos was officially open for service on Tuesday.
Undertaken by China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) since 2010, the completed tracks of the Lagos Rail Mass Transit (LRMT) Blue Line project span 13 km in the first phase and cover five stations.
The LRMT Blue Line project is the first rail infrastructure traversing Okokomaiko, a densely populated area in the western part of Lagos, and Marina, a business district on Lagos Island.
Speaking at a banquet held by the Lagos state government before the inauguration ceremony, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari described the project as ""historic,"" noting that the rail will reduce traffic congestion and air pollution, as well as improve the lives of locals.
The president also attended the contract signing ceremony for the construction of the second phase of the LRMT Blue Line project by the Lagos metropolitan area transport authority and the CCECC.
Cui Jianchun, the Chinese ambassador to Nigeria, said the completion of the first phase of the project demonstrated the harmony of China-Nigeria relations.
""It is a line of speed, line of sustainability, line of harmony,"" Cui said.
The new light rail would reduce travel time, improve the quality of life of citizens and make Lagos one of the most resilient megacities in Africa that would compete favorably with other cities around the world, said Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos.
The iconic Marina Station has the capacity to process about 25,000 passengers per hour, Sanwo-Olu added.
Construction of the first phase of the Lagos Blue Line project started in July 2010 and was completed in December 2022.

""China's optimization of its COVID-19 strategy could drive our tourism growth, our export growth to China, and inflows of Chinese investments into Cambodia,"" she said at the forum.
Narin said Cambodia's economy is forecast to grow by 5.6 percent in 2023, up from 5.2 percent in 2022, supported by the garment and non-garment manufacturing sectors, agriculture, and tourism.
""This year, our manufacturing sector is projected to grow by 5.5 percent, agriculture is forecast to increase by 1.1 percent, and tourism is expected to see a big jump,"" she said.
She added that the construction and real estate sector, which is one of the key pillars supporting the economy, will continue to see a sluggish recovery after being severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic in the past few years.
Narin said the predicted growth for 2023 remained ""high and resilient"" despite challenges caused by global uncertainties, rising protectionism and climate change.
She added that the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership trade pact, the Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement, and the Cambodia-South Korea Free Trade Agreement would continue to support the kingdom's economic growth in the long term.

Germany approves sending Leopard tanks to Ukraine,"BERLIN, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- The German government has decided to provide Ukraine with 14 Leopard 2A6 battle tanks from its own Bundeswehr stocks. The aim is to ""quickly assemble"" two tank battalions with additional units coming from European partners, the government said on Wednesday.
""This decision follows our well-known line of supporting Ukraine to the best of our ability,"" Chancellor Olaf Scholz said at a government meeting in Berlin. ""We are acting in a closely coordinated manner internationally.""
Other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have recently put pressure on Germany to supply battle tanks to Ukraine. On Tuesday, Poland was the first country to officially request Berlin's approval to send tanks from its own stock.
As Germany will now supply Leopard tanks to Ukraine, NATO partners were also given the go-ahead to do so. Ukrainian crews are also to be provided with training on the Leopard tanks as well as logistics, ammunition and maintenance for the systems, the government said.
Shipments of Leopard tanks to Ukraine would ""not bode well"" for Russian-German relations and will ""undoubtedly leave an unavoidable mark for the future of these relations,"" Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agency TASS on Tuesday.
Last Friday, Germany's Minister of Defense Boris Pistorius postponed the decision and instead announced further deliveries of Marder infantry fighting vehicles, Gepard anti-aircraft tanks and a Patriot surface-to-air missile system to Ukraine.

Biden announces equipping Ukraine with U.S.-made tanks,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Joe Biden announced Wednesday that his administration will provide Ukraine with 31 U.S.-made M1 Abrams tanks, which Russia has said will be its target if they were to be used in the ongoing conflict between Moscow and Kiev.
""Today I'm announcing that the United States will be sending 31 Abrams tanks to Ukraine, the equivalent of one Ukrainian battalion,"" Biden said, addressing the nation in televised remarks from the White House.
Biden said the decision was recommended by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who, together with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, flanked Biden as he spoke. ""Because it'll enhance Ukraine's capacity to defend its territory and achieve the strategic objectives,"" Biden said.
Biden said the United States is also sending Ukraine parts and equipment necessary to sustain the sophisticated tanks, adding that Washington will soon begin to train Ukrainian soldiers on how to operate and maintain the tanks, the delivery of which, he noted, will take time.
The U.S. delivery of M1 Abrams tanks, among the most powerful and capable of the kind in the world, is considered yet another major development in the Ukraine crisis, potentially further escalating the situation as other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) also intended to aid Ukraine with tanks.
Before the formal announcement by Biden, reports of U.S. provision of the M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine had already infuriated Russia.
Moscow's ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Antonov, said Tuesday that ""if a decision to transfer to Kiev M1 Abrams is made, American tanks without any doubt will be destroyed as all other samples of NATO military equipment.""
""If the United States decides to supply tanks, it will be impossible to justify such step using arguments about 'defensive weapons,'"" the envoy said. ""This would be another blatant provocation against the Russian Federation.""
The U.S. commitment came on the heel of the confirmation from Germany that it will deliver 14 Leopard 2 A6 tanks to Ukraine, ending a stalemate where a previously reluctant Germany found itself under increasing pressure from the United States and other allies to authorize tank shipment to Ukraine, which has long demanded such weapons.
Other NATO countries, including Poland, the Netherlands, Norway and Spain, have either committed to or been considering sending Ukraine the Leopard 2 tanks. Britain has already said it will send its Challenger 2 tanks to aid Ukraine's offensive in the conflict with Russia.
Biden said in his remarks that earlier in the day, he spoke with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni ""as part of our close coordination on support for Ukraine.""

Pirhossein Kolivand made the remarks during a meeting of the heads of the national red cross and red crescent societies in the Middle East and North Africa being held in Beirut, capital of Lebanon.
The negative impacts of the U.S. sanctions Kolivand listed include foreign banks' refrainment from cooperation in transfer of money to and from Iran and Iran's difficulties in importing medicine and medical equipment and rescue items.
The sanctions have also hindered Iran's ability to update its rescue and relief fleet and equipment, he added.
Iran has been under the U.S. sanctions for the past four decades. The sanctions intensified following the U.S. withdrawal from a 2015 nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, signed between Iran and world powers in July 2015.
Although the United States claims that humanitarian items, including medicine and foodstuff, are not included in the sanctions list, its embargoes on Iran's oil exports and banking sector have in practice prevented the country from importing such goods.

Global economy likely to beat forecasts as China rebounds: Nordea Bank,"HELSINKI, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- The global economy may outperform expectations this year despite its current slow growth, the European financial services group Nordea Bank said in a press release on Wednesday.
High inflation is eroding households' purchasing power, and in the Nordic countries the housing markets face a sharp slowdown.
However, according to the Helsinki-based bank, the recent economic developments have been surprisingly positive and ""there are signs that the year 2023 could also cause positive surprises.""
The mild winter has cushioned the harmful effects of the energy crisis in the eurozone, and China's rapid reopening after the COVID-19 lockdowns is returning the country to as a strong driver of the global economy, Tuuli Koivu, chief economist at Nordea Bank, said.
But risks remain. The tight labor market and rising inflation in the United States and the eurozone may result in a return to tighter monetary policy and an economic slowdown.
For Finland, Nordea Bank, the largest financial services group in the Nordic region and one of the biggest banks in Europe, projects zero gross domestic product (GDP) growth this year and 1 percent growth in 2024.
The growth of Finland's economy slowed down at the end of 2022, when the strong rise in energy prices and interest rates reduced private consumption and export demand. As a result, the economic outlook for this year is very mixed with bleak consumer and corporate confidence.
However, inflation in the country is expected to ease along with an anticipated wage growth, which would relieve household finances towards the end of the year, the bank said.
At the same time, economic growth in the Nordic states will shrink by 0.5 percent this year and will grow by 0.9 percent next year, while the global economy will grow by 3.2 percent in 2023 and by 2.7 percent in 2024, the bank said.

The UN World Economic Situation and Prospects 2023 report predicted global growth to moderately pick up to 2.7 percent in 2024, as some macroeconomic headwinds are expected to begin to subside next year.
Amid high inflation, aggressive monetary tightening and heightened uncertainties, the current downturn has slowed the pace of economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, threatening several countries -- both developed and developing -- with the prospects of recession in 2023, the report said.
It said growth momentum significantly weakened in the United States, the European Union and other developed economies in 2022, adversely impacting the rest of the global economy through a number of channels.
In the United States, gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to expand by only 0.4 percent in 2023 after an estimated growth of 1.8 percent in 2022, the report said.

Growth in China is projected to moderately improve in 2023. With the government adjusting its COVID policy in late 2022 and easing monetary and fiscal policies, China's economic growth is forecast to accelerate to 4.8 percent in 2023, according to the report.
It pointed out that tightening global financial conditions, coupled with a strong dollar, exacerbated fiscal and debt vulnerabilities in developing countries.
Most developing countries saw a slower job recovery in 2022 and continue to face considerable employment slack, the report said.
It warned that slower growth, coupled with elevated inflation and mounting debt vulnerabilities, threatens to further set back hard-won achievements in sustainable development, deepening the already negative effects of the current crises.
In 2022, the number of people facing acute food insecurity more than doubled compared to 2019, reaching almost 350 million. A prolonged period of economic weakness and slow income growth would not only hamper poverty eradication, but also constrain countries' ability to invest in the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) more broadly, the report stressed.
""The current crises are hitting the most vulnerable the hardest -- often through no fault of their own. The global community needs to step up joint efforts to avert human suffering and support an inclusive and sustainable future for all,"" Li Junhua, UN undersecretary-general for economic and social affairs, said in a statement on the release of the report.

The report called for governments to avoid fiscal austerity which would stifle growth and disproportionately affect the most vulnerable groups, affect progress in gender equality and stymie development prospects across generations.
It recommended reallocation and reprioritization of public expenditures through direct policy interventions that will create jobs and reinvigorate growth, noting this will require strengthening of social protection systems, ensuring continued support through targeted and temporary subsidies, cash transfers, and discounts on utility bills, which can be complemented with reductions in consumption taxes or custom duties.
""The pandemic, the global food and energy crises, climate risks and the looming debt crisis in many developing countries are testing the limits of existing multilateral frameworks,"" the report said. ""International cooperation has never been more important than now to face multiple global crises and bring the world back on track to achieve the SDGs.""
Additional SDG financing needs in developing countries vary by source, but are estimated to amount to a few trillion U.S. dollars per year, according to the report.
Stronger international commitment, the report said, is urgently needed to expand access to emergency financial assistance, to restructure and reduce debt burdens across developing countries, and scale up SDG financing.

Suspect of California mass shooting on Lunar New Year's Eve found dead,"
Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna speaks at a press conference in front of the Civic Center in Monterey Park, California, the United States, Jan. 22, 2023. The suspect of the California mass shooting on Saturday night was found dead in another city of what authorities believe was a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- The suspect of the California mass shooting on Saturday night was found dead in another city of what authorities believe was a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
Five women and five men were killed while another 10 people were injured in a mass shooting in the city of Monterey Park, 16 km east of Los Angeles downtown, the authorities said Sunday.
The fatal incident occurred at 10:22 p.m. (06:22 GMT) Saturday local time in Star Ballroom Dance Studio, a popular ballroom dance facility operated for about 30 years, when it was hosting an event to celebrate the countdown to the Chinese Lunar New Year.
Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said Sunday evening that the suspect was identified as Huu Can Tran, who entered the party and opened fire before fleeing the scene in a white van.
The vehicle was pulled over in a parking lot Sunday morning and surrounded by policemen from Torrance, located roughly 50 km southwest of Monterey Park after they heard a gunshot from inside the vehicle.
The man inside the van, who was found dead following a three-hour standoff with the Special Weapons and Tactics team, was confirmed as the suspect later, according to Luna.
No motive was disclosed at a Sunday evening news conference.
Monterey Park, a city of 61,000 residents located on the eastern edge of Los Angeles, has a majority Asian American population. Starting Saturday, the city hosted an annual two-day Chinese Lunar New Year celebration, one of the largest events in the region.
Thousands of shoppers took part in Saturday's celebrations which was concluded about one hour before the fatal shooting. The festivities scheduled for Sunday have been canceled.

Avian flu could decimate Australian black swans: study,"SYDNEY, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- A new research led by the University of Queensland (UQ) has revealed that the unique genetics of Australian black swan leaves the species vulnerable to viral illnesses such as avian flu.
The research, published in Genome Biology on Monday, generated a first-ever genome of the black swan, which revealed the species lacks some immune genes which help other wild waterfowl combat infectious diseases, implicating the importance of biosecurity and conservation awareness.
Co-author of the paper Kirsty Short from UQ's School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences said the geographic isolation of Australia's black swans means limited exposure to pathogens commonly found in other parts of the world, leading to reduced immune diversity.
""Unlike Mallard ducks for example, black swans are extremely sensitive to highly pathogenic avian influenza -- HPAI which is often referred to as bird flu -- and can die from it within three days,"" Short said.
""Our data suggests that the immune system of the black swan is such that, should any avian viral infection become established in its native habitat, their survival would be in peril.""
Short noted though HPAI is not currently in Australia, it has spread from Asia to North America, Europe, North Africa and South America, and the risk to the species is ""very real.""
""When it was introduced to new locations, such as Chile and Peru, thousands of wild seabirds perished,"" she said.
Over the years there have been small homegrown instances of HPAI viruses in Australia.
The recent largest outbreak of HPAI viruses (H7 subtypes) was in Victoria in 2020, which involved considerable cost and losses to the Victorian poultry industry, according to the Australian Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.
In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Short said the finding that black swans were missing key genes could also suggest they were probably susceptible to a lot of other different viruses, apart from avian flu.
With the findings from the study, researchers and conservationists hope it could help increase awareness about how vulnerable Australia's bird species are to avian influenza and the highly precarious situation they are in.

ISTANBUL, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- A new metro line connecting central Istanbul and the city's new international airport officially opened to the public on Sunday, featuring China-made automated driverless trains that could run up to 120 kilometers per hour.
""This 800,000 daily capacity metro line will allow travel from Kagithane Station to the Istanbul Airport in 24 minutes,"" said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during the opening ceremony.
The fully-automated, driverless trains were built by Chinese company CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd. (CRRC ZELC), which signed a purchase and commissioning contract with Trkiye's Directorate-General of Infrastructure Investments back in January 2020.
The 34-kilometer metro line between the Kagithane Station in central Istanbul and the city's new international airport boasts Trkiye's fastest trains, and the vehicles running the line are China's first 120km/h automated driverless metro project for the overseas market, according to CRRC ZELC.
The contract was for 176 subway cars and required a 60 percent localization rate in Trkiye.
Haluk Oguz, a management specialist at CRRC ZELC's subsidiary in Trkiye, told Xinhua that they have delivered 40 vehicles. ""Work on the other 136 is ongoing,"" he said, adding ""they will be manufactured at our factory in Ankara.""
Faruk Bostanci, administrative affairs chief at CRRC Trkiye, said that ""new additions (to the line), which will be made as manufacturing continues, will increase the train frequency and provide a faster, more convenient transportation network for Istanbul residents.""
After trying out the train, Istanbul resident Emirhan Ersoy praised the new vehicles. ""Both the heating system and the visual screens are very nice, and the sound system works very well,"" he said, adding that the high capacity of the cabins was another point of distinction.
The vehicles operate in a 4-car formation with a maximum capacity of 1,100 passengers. The exterior of the trains is decorated with Turkish cultural elements such as tulip motifs.
Yalcin Eyigun, general manager of the Directorate-General of Infrastructure Investments at Turkish Transportation and Infrastructure Ministry, praised the Chinese partner for overcoming all kinds of difficulties during the project despite the COVID-19 pandemic-related setbacks.
Over the past decade, CRRC ZELC has supplied more than 400 metro vehicles to Trkiye, which are now operating in its three largest cities, namely Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir.
Zhou Qinghe, chairman of the board of the CRRC ZELC, said that his company is willing to strengthen cooperation with Trkiye and write new chapters of ""shared growth through discussion and collaboration.""

ISLAMABAD, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- Millions of Pakistanis encountered power outage on Monday morning after the power distribution system of the South Asian country broke down, said the ministry of energy.
The energy ministry said in a statement the countrywide power breakdown was triggered after the frequency of the national grid decreased suddenly.
""According to initial reports, the system frequency of the national grid system decreased at 07:34 in the morning, which resulted in a widespread breakdown in the power system,"" said the ministry.
The ministry added that efforts were underway on a fast track to restore the system as early as possible.
Local media quoting unanimous officials from the ministry reported that it might take 24 hours to restore the system completely.
According to the local reports, all major cities including the capital Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta have lost power supply completely.
Quetta Electric Supply Company told local media that 22 districts of the country's southwest Balochistan province are without power.

"Davos may be over, but the weeklong affair left behind some lasting changes","GENEVA, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting 2023 closed on Friday, with more than 2,000 honorable guests participating in hundreds of sessions during the weeklong event.
This year's version remained unchanged in some respects. For instance, global elites gathered for brainstorming in the same ""Davos spirit,"" China was given plenty of attention and climate change was a hot topic.
But there were some notable and lasting changes.
GEOPOLITICAL EUROPE
First, a more divided Europe emerged from a surge in geopolitical confrontations, reflected in the absence of a Russian delegation from Davos.
Tensions between the West and Russia intensified during the Ukraine crisis. Europe has proceeded with ""de-Russification"" policies, particularly in its energy sector. Despite strategic partnerships between Russian companies and the forum, Russian political and business leaders were not invited to this year's event.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in his Davos speech that Germany had stopped importing Russian gas and coal, indicating ""a profound turning point in German foreign and security policy.""
Similarly, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen revealed that Europe has collectively reduced its foreign dependence on pipeline gas by 80 percent in less than one year.
Their statements imply that ""de-Russification"" is underway in Europe, yet its outcome remains unknown.
CONSENSUS ON GLOBAL CHALLENGES
Another change is the growing consensus that humanity's challenges have never been greater, evolving from regional and individual issues to global and interconnected ones.
As the first in-person event held since the COVID-19 pandemic, organizers described this year's affair as occurring amid the most complex geopolitical and geo-economic situation in decades.
WEF Founder and Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab has repeatedly stressed that today's world is facing multiple unprecedented crises, such as an energy transition, the pandemic, climate change and geopolitical tensions.
In addition, a wobbling global economy, widening deficits in global governance, food and energy crises ... the list of unprecedented challenges tormenting humanity seems unending and is growing.
""Our world is plagued by a perfect storm on a number of fronts,"" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in his Wednesday speech. ""We are in the worst situation I can remember in my lifetime,"" he warned.
Not coincidentally, Gim Huay Neo, managing director of the WEF's Centre for Nature and Climate, deemed the multiple crises the ""new normal of the planet.""
SHIFT TO RESILIENCE
Third, the mood has shifted away from a focus on growth to a focus on resilience.
A global economic recovery remains fragile and tortuous, with many countries grappling with supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. Policymakers are being called upon to take robust measures to build up resilience.
""Black swan"" events over the past three years have made economic resilience a core agenda for every country and business, said Khaldoon Khalifa Al Mubarak, CEO of Mubadala Investment Company, calling for moving from a cost-driven to a resilience-driven mindset.
Michelle Williams, dean of the faculty at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, said the ""long COVID"" impact on the economic and financial sectors is here to stay and that the entire health system and societies must rebuild resilience from such an impact.
For her part, Egyptian Minister of International Cooperation Rania A. Al-Mashat said Egypt knows firsthand the impact of climate change and firmly believes that investing in climate protection is investing in economic resilience.
Other topics at the forum included a growing call for re-globalization, artificial intelligence, the meta-universe and data regulations, and such emerging topics as future work styles and demographic trends.
All shed light on the current evolution and development of humanity. But one thing remains unchanged: Only in unity can the global community make steady progress and achieve its long-term goals.

Experts highlight challenges in fighting COVID-19 at WEF,"GENEVA, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- Public health experts and officials attending the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting 2023 have cautioned against some major challenges in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, as Omicron variants are still spreading rampantly worldwide.
They emphasized the impact of long COVID, vaccine inequality and pandemic-related misinformation at the meeting held at Davos, Switzerland.
PANDEMIC ""FAR FROM OVER""
While the COVID situation has been better than that in the early stages, Michelle Williams, dean of the faculty at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, warned at the WEF that the ""bottom line is this pandemic is far from over.""
Williams said that there are still 526 deaths per day from COVID-19 across the United States, up from about 400 per day in October last year.
""What's really disappointing is nine out of 10 of those deaths could be averted,"" if vaccines and boosters would have been taken, and other behavioral aspects, such as ventilation, mask-wearing, and appropriate social distancing practised, Williams said.
""So for me as a public health person, knowing that we could avert nine out of 10 of those deaths reminds me of the fact that we have to avoid prematurely talking about this pandemic being over,"" she said.
The expert also cited social-economic implications that ""long COVID"" would inflict upon society in the future.
""In the U.S. alone, over 174,000 COVID infants will have a life course impacted by this pandemic,"" she said. ""And it's not only going to be impacting individuals and families, but the economic impact of long COVID ... is that it's going to cost us 3.7 trillion (U.S.) dollars. That's going to have financial impacts.""
VACCINE INEQUALITY
While COVAX was launched in 2020 to accelerate the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines and to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) has long been complaining about rich countries stockpiling the majority of multiple vaccine supplies.
Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, said at the WEF that for three years in half of the lower-income countries, 53 percent of the population have got their primary vaccination. Globally, the coverage rate is 64 percent.
""We realize that the disparities were still there,"" Berkley said.
Addressing a panel discussion at the WEF, Michael Ryan, executive director of WHO's Health Emergencies Program, said that ""there is no way out of this pandemic right now without vaccines as the central strategic pillar.""
""Being able to use those vaccines equitably is not only a fair and important humanitarian objective, it's the best way for us all to get out of the pandemic phase that we're currently in right now,"" Ryan said.
To ensure vaccine equity, Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a global vaccine partnership, called on countries and manufacturers at the WEF to prioritize vaccine supply to the global program COVAX and to support the local production of tests, vaccines and treatments around the world.
Hatchett also asked pharmaceutical companies to stand in solidarity with developing countries by sharing licences, know-how and technology to find a way out of the pandemic.
BUILDING TRUST
Even with enough vaccines and preparedness, response to similar public health crises in the future could still be compromised, if there is a lack of solid trust between the public, governments and academia. Meanwhile, the rampant spread of misinformation on social media would also make things worse.
Williams said a diverse society needs to have multiple layers of communicators and different styles of communicating.
The expert said governments should understand the people and the communities they are serving, reckon with the reasons for mistrust, and then work collaboratively and respectfully in addressing the appropriate message and messenger to promote change.
""That's where a better understanding and behavioral sciences are going to help us,"" said Williams.
Berkley pinpointed ""intentional misinformation"" as one of the challenges, while citing the bad COVID situation in the United States as an example.
""It's about the political climate and misinformation ... That's really unfortunate,"" Berkley said. ""And even other external experts, who might have been able to help, were then also demonized.""
The WHO has labeled the pandemic-related misinformation as an ""infodemic,"" which refers to ""too much information including false or misleading information in digital and physical environments during a disease outbreak.""
It has called for an infodemic management by listening to community concerns and questions, promoting understanding of risk and health expert advice, building resilience to misinformation, and engaging and empowering communities to take positive action.

Protesters hit streets in U.S. after deadly police beating of Tyre Nichols,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- Protesters hit the streets in some U.S. cities following the release of footage Friday night showing a deadly police beating of an African American man.
The hour-long video captured several police officers beating Tyre Nichols, 29, during a traffic stop on Jan. 7 in Memphis, Tennessee, where they allegedly stopped him for reckless driving.
The officers pepper-sprayed and shocked Nichols with Taser while they can also be seen beating the motorist with a baton and kicking and punching him. Nichols, subdued, kept yelling ""mom.""
Nichols died three days later in a hospital after the confrontation due to cardiac arrest and kidney failure.
David Rausch, director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, told reporters on Friday that he saw the video before it was released to the public and found it ""absolutely appalling.""
""What happened here does not at all reflect proper policing. This was wrong. This was criminal,"" Rausch said.
Demonstrations have broken out in a series of cities, including Memphis, Washington, D.C., New York, Atlanta, and Los Angeles, over the police treatment of Nichols this weekend.
""Shame on this system,"" protesters chanted in downtown Washington, D.C., on Friday night.
U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement that he was ""outraged and deeply pained to see the horrific video of the beating that resulted in Tyre Nichols' death.""
""It is yet another painful reminder of the profound fear and trauma, the pain, and the exhaustion that Black and Brown Americans experience every single day,"" Biden stressed.
The five officers involved in the death of Nichols were fired after an internal investigation and are facing criminal charges, including second-degree murder.
The incident came nearly three years after the police murder of 46-year-old African American man George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Floyd died on May 25, 2020, after an encounter with Minneapolis police, during which officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes during a street arrest. Floyd's death sparked outrage and protests across the United States in the summer of 2020 against police brutality and systemic racism.
Police killed 1,186 people in the United States last year, according to Mapping Police Violence. African Americans were 26 percent of those killed by police in 2022 despite accounting for only 13 percent of the population.

Billstrom told Swedish Television on Saturday that the ministry of foreign affairs had put a lot of work into the recent weeks' anger against Sweden, and that it might take a while for it (anti-Sweden sentiment) to subside after such a big event.
Sweden suffered a major setback in its bid for NATO membership after events earlier this month that saw protests against the Turkish president and the burning of a copy of the Quran in Stockholm.

PRAGUE, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- The second round of the Czech presidential election concluded Saturday, with retired general Petr Pavel winning over former prime minister Andrej Babis, according to official results.
With 99.99 percent of precincts counted, Pavel won with 58.32 percent of the vote to Babis' 41.67 percent. Turnover for the election surpassed 70 percent.
Voters cast their ballots on Friday and Saturday, with Czechs abroad heading to the polls on Thursday. The first round, which took place on Jan. 13-14, featured eight candidates before going to a run-off between the two men after Pavel received 35.4 percent of the vote and Babis received 34.99 percent.
Pavel, 61, served as head of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Military Committee. He was endorsed by the current ruling government coalition. Babis, 68, the head of the Action of Dissatisfied Citizens (ANO) party, served as prime minister from 2017 to 2021.
In his victory speech, Pavel called on Czechs to work together to get through differences and solve the country's various challenges.
""It is important that we are able to solve problems together, as one community,"" Pavel said at an election watch party in Prague. He said that the Czech society was not only divided by the campaign but also by the hardships the country is currently facing.
The president of the Czech Republic is chosen in a direct election and serves a term of five years. The mandate can be held for a maximum of two consecutive terms. Incumbent President Milos Zeman's term concludes in March.

U.S. invasion of Panama left enduring scars on victims' families,"PANAMA CITY, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- It's poignant for Trinidad Ayola to recall the day when she claimed from the hospital the body of her husband, whose life was taken during the 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama.
Trauma still lingers for Panamanians like Ayola whose families died during the invasion, though the National Mourning Day, which was established last March and falls on Dec. 20 each year, offered a welcome occasion to mourn the loss of hundreds of lives.
""It seems the stars have aligned,"" said Ayola, who took part in a years-long campaign to make the national tragedy officially recognized.
Ayola's husband was a lieutenant in the Panamanian Air Force. ""I could prepare a proper funeral for him, but there were at least 30 families that continued to search for the remains of loved ones who disappeared in the military operation,"" said Ayola.
Casualty numbers vary. The UN estimated around 500 civilian deaths in the month-long battle ending late January 1990, whereas some other organizations said the figure could be 1,000 to 3,000 in total.
""It was not necessary to kill so many people and launch an invasion to defend what they called democracy,"" said Ayola.
Ayola suffered from anxiety and insomnia for the following seven years, and her young daughter experienced emotional stress and trauma.
Panamanians agree that force was disproportionately used to humiliate the small country. The U.S. invasion destroyed homes and businesses, and plunged many into poverty in its wake.
The invasion, dubbed ""Operation Just Cause"" by the United States, was only aimed at protecting American interests, said Ayola.
That still rings true today, she continued, with Washington ""blockading other nations to subdue them, inflicting hunger, lack of health care and misery on them.""

XBB.1.5 is spreading quickly in the United States. It made up 37.5 percent of the total cases in the week ending Jan. 14, and rose to 49.5 percent in the week ending Jan. 21, according to the CDC.
XBB.1.5 is currently the most transmissible variant in the country. The subvariant may spur more COVID-19 cases based on genetic characteristics and early growth rate estimates, according to the World Health Organization.
Another two dominant Omicron subvariants BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 accounted for about 30 percent of new COVID-19 cases in the United States in the latest week, CDC data showed.
The CDC this week published the first estimate of the updated COVID-19 booster shot's efficacy against XBB.1.5, finding that the shots are at least 40 percent effective against symptomatic illness from subvariants XBB.1.5 and XBB among fully vaccinated adults within three months of the shot's administration.

At the end of fiscal 2022, 14,445 entities were registered with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls to conduct defense trade activities, which is a slight increase from fiscal 2021, the department said in a press release dated Wednesday.
The State Department attributed the spike to continuous U.S. provision of military assistance to Ukraine amid the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, while claiming that ""arms transfers and defense trade are important tools of U.S. foreign policy.""
According to the Defense Department's latest update released Wednesday, the United States has more than 27.1 billion dollars in security assistance for Ukraine since the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out on Feb. 24, 2022.
The 2022 arms sales numbers are potential deals the State Department has notified Congress, not the final sales, meaning some of the transactions may be refused by Congress, thus forcing the administration to engage in further negotiations.
As far as the destinations of those sales are concerned, they cover U.S. allies and partners in Europe, as demands for U.S. weapons soared especially in NATO countries, and in the Asia Pacific and the Middle East regions.

""It is a pity that the book said the Turkish army does not have the capacity to defeat Daesh (the Islamic State),"" Cavusoglu told a press conference that was also attended by visiting Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai.
""The only army fighting close combat against Daesh was the Turkish army. While we were clearing the north of Syria from Daesh, the U.S. sent the YPG and Daesh members to Afghanistan by planes and buses during Pompeo's tenure. They are responsible for the attacks in Afghanistan,"" Cavusoglu said.
The Turkish minister said he believed Pompeo's purpose to write the book was to propel him to the U.S. presidency.
Ankara considers the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) as the Syrian branch of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is listed as a terrorist organization by TÃ¼rkiye, the United States and the European Union and has rebelled against the Turkish government for over three decades.
Pompeo, who served as U.S. secretary of state between 2018 and 2021, said in his book ""Never Give an Inch: Fighting for the America I Love"" that he was worried that Ankara's plan to fight against the IS could lead to ethnic cleansing of the Kurds in Syria.
Ties between the two NATO member states have long been strained due to U.S. military support to the YPG, which cooperated with Washington in carrying out operations against the IS.
The Turkish army launched Operation Euphrates Shield in 2016, Operation Olive Branch in 2018, Operation Peace Spring in 2019, and Operation Spring Shield in 2020 in northern Syria targeting both the IS and the YPG groups.

IMF chief affirms support for climate financing in developing countries,"KIGALI, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Kristalina Georgieva Wednesday affirmed her organization's support for climate financing in developing countries.
""We believe that developing countries deserve to have access to long-term financing to underpin their structural transformation, the investment in climate resilience and low carbon development,"" Georgieva told a round table discussion with East African region central bank governors and ministers of finance in Rwanda's capital city Kigali.
The discussion focused on climate financing schemes for developing countries and the operational context of the IMF's resilience and sustainability facility.
Participants also discussed innovative homegrown solutions to mitigate climate change and how the international community can support or act as a catalyst to mobilize public and private financing.
""The IMF is committed to supporting countries' climate policies, especially through the new Resilience and Sustainability Facility which countries can use as a catalyst for investment to build resilience,"" Georgieva said.
She noted that the IMF attaches great significance to climate action in the context of preserving macroeconomic stability and promoting growth and employment.
She also stressed the need for Africa to be at the center of climate finance negotiations.
Africa has contributed very little to the problem, but it is already suffering the consequences of climate change in a very dramatic way, she said.
""In Africa, drought and floods are causing loss of productivity, agriculture produce, harming people and communities,"" she added.
Developed countries had pledged nearly 100 billion U.S. dollars per year by 2020 for climate action in developing countries, which is yet to be fulfilled.
Last December, the IMF announced a 319 million U.S. dollars loan for Rwanda under the resilience and sustainability facility, to support the country's ambitious agenda to build resilience to climate change and help to catalyze further financing, the first for an African country.
The initiative aims at helping low-income and vulnerable middle-income member countries to address longer-term structural challenges such as climate change with longer-term low-cost financing.

* Delivering tanks in all likelihood will lead Russia and NATO to teeter on the brink of a direct conflict, said Fyodor Lukyanov, research director of the Russian think tank Valdai International Discussion Club.
* Washington is ""happy to delegate the right to participate in the escalation to its European allies, in particular Germany,"" Lukyanov said.
BEIJING, Jan. 27 (Xinhua) -- Germany and the United States separately announced on Wednesday that they will send advanced battle tanks to Ukraine, ending a stalemate where a previously reluctant Germany found itself under increasing pressure from its allies to authorize tank shipments to Ukraine.
While Kiev welcomed the tanks, expecting them to be a game-changer in the battlefield against Russia, analysts expressed concerns that such heavy weapons may intensify the situation, warning of the possibility of a direct war between Russia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

NATO'S PROMISE OF TANKS FOR UKRAINE
On Wednesday, the German government not only agreed to provide Ukraine with 14 Leopard 2 battle tanks from its own stocks but also approved of its customer countries doing the same.
""We are acting in a closely coordinated manner internationally,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said at a government meeting in Berlin.
Hours later, U.S. President Joe Biden announced that his administration will provide Ukraine with 31 U.S.-made M1 Abrams tanks. A day later, the Canadian Defense Ministry announced it would send four Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine and is considering sending more at a later date.
Ahead of the latest promised supplies, some other NATO countries had announced increasing weapon supplies to Ukraine, especially heavier weapons.
Britain said on Jan. 14 it would send 14 Challenger 2 main battle tanks to aid Ukraine's offensive against Russia, while other NATO countries, including Poland, the Netherlands, Norway and Spain, have either committed to or been considering sending Ukraine Leopard 2 tanks, though Berlin's approval -- a re-export requirement -- had not been given at that time.
According to military arms experts, the German-made Leopard 2 is one of the most reputable battle tanks in the world, perhaps second only to the U.S.-made M1 Abrams tank.
The deliveries of Leopard 2 tanks will take Ukrainian ground forces to a qualitatively new level, Ukrainian military expert Oleh Zhdanov told The Associated Press.
However, Huang Rihan, professor at the School of International Relations of China's Huaqiao University, told Xinhua that tanks from so many different countries need time to adapt to the front-line situation in Ukraine, which will limit their performance.
""Therefore, it is a bit of an exaggeration to say now that these tanks will drastically change the battlefield situation,"" he said.

DIVISIONS AMONG NATO ALLIES
Germany's move was announced following weeks of mounting pressure from its allies, including the United States and other NATO members, who urged Berlin to step up its military support to Ukraine.
Unlike countries such as the United States, Germany has been more cautious in providing heavier weapons to Ukraine, trying to avoid an escalation of the deterioration of German-Russian relations.
Ahead of Germany's decision, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov had told Russian news agency TASS that shipments of Leopard tanks to Ukraine would ""not bode well"" for Russian-German relations and would ""undoubtedly leave an unavoidable mark for the future of these relations.""
Earlier this month at Davos, when asked about supplying tanks to Ukraine, Scholz said ""we are never doing something just by ourselves, but together with others, especially the United States.""
At that time, some analysts said Germany was trying to dodge the front-runner-role in fueling the present war. However, Washington responded that it was Germany's own decision whether to supply Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine.

Russia on Thursday slammed Western promises to supply Ukraine with heavy tanks, saying it saw the development as evidence of direct and growing U.S. and European involvement in the conflict.
""It (providing tanks) reveals ... Washington does not want the war to end,"" Huang said, ""such a protracted war would be in America's best interest.""
Washington is ""happy to delegate the right to participate in the escalation to its European allies, in particular Germany,"" Lukyanov was quoted by TASS news agency as saying.
""Germany risks being drawn directly into the war as a result,"" Tino Chrupalla, co-leader of the far-right party Alternative for Germany, has said on social media.

The Left Party, another opposition party in Germany, also warned of a possible escalation of the conflict. ""The supply of Leopard battle tanks, which ends a further taboo, potentially takes us closer to a third world war than in the direction of peace in Europe,"" the party's parliamentary leader, Dietmar Bartsch, was quoted by German news agency DPA as saying.
The attitude of the United States and NATO is an important factor in determining whether peace can be achieved, Huang said.
""Today's Russia-Ukraine situation is largely caused by NATO's eastward expansion,"" he said, calling on the United States and other NATO countries to play a constructive role.
""The prolonged conflict between Russia and Ukraine is disastrous for Europe and the world economy. If we want the world to resume sound development, we must return to the road of peace talks,"" Huang said.

UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council on Monday adopted a resolution to extend the mandate of the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) for 12 months, till Jan. 31, 2024.
Resolution 2674, which won the unanimous support of the 15-member council, approves an extension of 12 months for the first time instead of the past practice of six-month renewals.
The resolution affirms the Security Council's intention to continue to closely monitor the situation in Cyprus and its readiness to review the implementation of this resolution after six months and to consider any adjustments or other actions as necessary.
The resolution expresses the Security Council's serious concern and alarm at the continued violations of the military status quo along the cease-fire lines and urges the sides and all involved parties to respect UNFICYP's mandated authority in, and delineation of, the buffer zone.
It urgently calls on both sides to respect the integrity and inviolability of the buffer zone, to remove all unauthorized constructions and to prevent unauthorized military or civilian activities within and along the cease-fire lines.
It stresses that UNFICYP's mandated authority extends throughout Cyprus, calls on all parties to continue to cooperate with UNFICYP and strongly urges full respect for UNFICYP's freedom of movement throughout Cyprus and the cessation of all restrictions on the mission's movement and access.
The resolution deeply regrets the lack of progress on an effective mechanism for direct military contacts between the sides and the relevant involved parties, and urges flexibility and engagement by the sides and the relevant involved parties to develop a suitably acceptable proposal on the establishment of such a mechanism and its timely implementation.
It calls on the sides to reduce existing barriers to intercommunal contact, emphasizes the importance of effective communication for risk mitigation and trust building between the communities, and urges the sides to agree and implement further confidence-building measures that can contribute to a conducive environment for settlement.
The resolution fully supports the UN secretary-general's ongoing engagement with the sides and encourages further rounds of informal talks and reiterates the importance of the sides and all involved participants approaching this process in the spirit of openness, flexibility and compromise and showing the necessary political will and commitment to freely negotiate a mutually acceptable settlement under UN auspices. It continues to urge the sides to engage actively and without further delay with the secretary-general and his team to this end, and further urges the sides to reach an agreement regarding the proposal of the secretary-general to appoint a UN envoy for Cyprus.
After independence in 1960, the tensions between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots increased. UNFICYP was set up by the UN Security Council in 1964 to prevent further fighting between the two sides.
Turkish troops occupied the northern part of Cyprus in 1974 in reaction to a coup by Athens-backed Greek Cypriots, splitting the country into two. The Security Council mandated the force to perform additional functions after 1974.

Bangladesh mulls introducing integrated traffic management system,"DHAKA, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is planning to introduce the Integrated Traffic Management and Incident Detection System (ITMIDS) to ensure safer highways, an official said.
The ITMIDS will be undertaken to detect speed and traffic violations and enable traffic flow analysis, while the real-time monitoring will be replicated along some of the highway corridor pilots, said Roads and Highways Division (RHD) Additional Chief Engineer Md Abdullah Al Mamun.
The system will coincide with the National Highway Safe Corridor Demonstration Project Sites side by side CCTV, video and audio feeds, as well as Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology.
The government will introduce the ITMIDS under the multi-sector Bangladesh Road Safety Project, which will be implemented by the RHD, the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), the Bangladesh Police and the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA).
The project costs 480.87 million U.S. dollars. The World Bank will provide 357.91 million U.S. dollars as credit, while the rest of 122.96 million U.S. dollars will come from government treasury.
Mamun said the project is now waiting for approval from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC).
He informed that the World Bank has already approved 357.91 million U.S. dollars of financing to help Bangladesh improve road safety and reduce fatalities and injuries from road crashes in selected high-risk highways and district roads.
The Road Safety Project will help Bangladesh achieve the Sustainable Development Goals on road safety by 2030, he added.
He said the project is aimed at building road safety management capacity and achieving targeted reduction in traffic fatalities and serious injuries in Bangladesh.

"Meloni, Michel discuss migration ahead of European Council meeting","ROME, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- Migration was a key focus of talks between Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and European Council President Charles Michel here on Monday. The leaders discussed key areas where Brussels and Rome are at odds, issues likely to be on the agenda at the upcoming Special European Council meeting.
Michel had traveled to Rome in preparation for the meeting on Feb. 9-10 in Brussels.
Addressing the media after closed-door talks with Michel, Meloni said current rules on migration, an area where Italy has sought stronger restrictions than those of the European Union (EU) as a whole, gave too much responsibility to countries where refugees first land in Europe.
Italy is one such country, along with Greece and Spain.
""It is not in anyone's interest for countries to have a rift over an issue like migration,"" Meloni said. ""Doing so would be the same as giving a gift to those who traffic human beings.""
She added: ""The European Union can and must intervene, starting from a defense of its external borders. Italy cannot manage the problem on its own.""
The summit would take place at a pivotal time, Michel said. Discussions will be held on the challenge of securing adequate energy amid the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the growing problem of long-term food security, and the issue of European competitiveness amid ""the massive state aid plan that the United States is implementing"" to help bolster its economy.
""The choices we make at the next European Council meeting will be decisive over the next ten years,"" Michel said.
While in Rome, Michel also met with leaders and senior officials of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, and the World Food Program to discuss food security.

JERUSALEM, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Israel on Monday, urging Israelis and Palestinians to calm tensions and reiterating Washington's ""ironclad"" commitment to Israel's security.
As part of his three-leg Middle East tour, Blinken arrived in Israel after visiting Egypt. This was his first meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since Netanyahu returned to office in December 2022 as the leader of a new extreme-right-wing and ultra-religious government.
At the airport upon his arrival, Blinken condemned the recent deadly attacks between Israelis and Palestinians.
""To take an innocent life in an act of terrorism is always a heinous crime,"" he said, adding Israeli calls for vengeance ""against more innocent victims are not the answer,"" as ""acts of retaliatory violence against civilians are never justified.""
In later joint statements with Netanyahu after their meeting, Blinken urged ""all sides to take urgent steps to restore calm and to de-escalate.""
""We want to make sure that there's an environment in which we can, I hope, at some point, create the conditions where we can start to restore a sense of security for Israelis and Palestinians alike, which of course is sorely lacking,"" he said.
His visit coincided with a flare of violence between Israelis and Palestinians. Since the beginning of 2023, at least 35 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces, according to official Palestinian figures.
Netanyahu did not mention the regional tensions in his statement. Instead, he talked about the Iranian ""aggression"" and his wish to expand the so-called Abraham Accords signed in 2020 in which the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco agreed to normalize ties with Israel.
""Expanding the circle of peace (and) working to close the issue of the Arab-Israeli conflict, I think, would also help us achieve a workable solution with our Palestinian neighbors,"" Netanyahu said.
For his part, Blinken said while the United States supports more normalization deals and the integration of Israel in the Middle East, ""these efforts are not a substitute for progress between Israelis and Palestinians.""
He repeated the U.S. commitment to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
""As we advance Israel's integration, we can do so in ways that improve the daily lives of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza,"" he said, noting Washington believes that establishing an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel is the way to move forward.
Blinken also had discussions with Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen and Israeli President Isaac Herzog.
The U.S. top diplomat has a scheduled trip to the Palestinian territories, where he will meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Tuesday.

ANKARA, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- TÃ¼rkiye could evaluate Finland's NATO bid separately from Sweden's bid to distinguish ""between a problematic country and a less problematic one,"" the Turkish foreign minister said on Monday.
""If NATO and these countries take such a decision, we, as TÃ¼rkiye, think that we may evaluate the applications separately. But first of all, NATO and these countries have to decide,"" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said at a joint press conference with his Portuguese counterpart Joao Gomes Cravinho.
Cavusoglu emphasized that the alliance and these countries initially requested that the membership process of the two countries be carried out together.
Since then, Finland has taken some steps, but there were ""provocations"" in Sweden, he said.
""We've been saying that we have fewer problems with Finland since the two countries' application process started. It would be fair to distinguish between a problematic country and a less problematic one,"" the minister explained.
On Sunday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that TÃ¼rkiye may show a different approach to Finland's NATO bid than Sweden.
""We may respond differently to Finland if necessary. Sweden would be shocked when we respond differently to Finland. But Finland should not make the same mistake,"" Erdogan said.

UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- A mission of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee to Afghanistan has reported positive signs concerning women's rights in the country.
The mission was sent to Afghanistan last week to look into the effects of the ban on women being employed in national and local and international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and humanitarian work that was promulgated by the Taliban on Dec. 24, 2022.
Days after the Dec. 24 edict, the Afghanistan minister of public health said this edict would not apply in the health sector. That was followed a few days later by a similar exception in the education sector. So there already was a record of exceptions, said UN Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths, who chairs the committee and led the mission to Afghanistan.
""And in addition to making clear our grave concern about the edict itself, we then also said, okay, if you're not rescinding the edict now, then we must expand these exceptions to cover all the aspects of humanitarian action. And that was the agenda with which we met all those de facto Taliban leaders,"" Griffiths told a press briefing on Monday.
He said the mission spent several days in Kabul and met with nine Taliban leaders, including the de facto acting foreign minister, the de facto acting economy minister, the first and the second deputy prime ministers, and the interior minister.
""So we expressed our opposition to the ban, hope for it to be rescinded, and in the meantime asked for further sectors to be granted these exceptions or authorizations for the role and the function of women,"" said Griffiths. ""In all these meetings, we were told that indeed, these such arrangements would be forthcoming ... we were asked to be patient.""
The mission was told that guidelines are being developed by the Taliban authorities, which would provide allegedly the role of functioning of women in humanitarian operations, he said.
""Let's see if these guidelines do come through,"" said Griffiths, adding that ""our view is that the message has clearly been delivered that women are central, essential workers in the humanitarian sector, in addition to having rights, and we need to see them back to work.""
The Inter-Agency Standing Committee is a humanitarian coordination forum of the UN system. It brings together the executive heads of 18 organizations and consortia, with members from within and outside the United Nations, to formulate policy, set strategic priorities and mobilize resources in response to humanitarian crises.
At Monday's press briefing, the deputy executive director for programs at the UN Children's Fund, Omar Abdi, said there are some positive signs concerning the Taliban's ban on girls attending secondary education.
Since the Dec. 20 ban, an estimated 200,000 girls have continued to attend secondary schools in around 12 provinces, and female secondary-school teachers continued to receive their salaries from the de facto authorities, he said.
""The officials we met in Kabul ... reaffirmed that they are not against girls learning in secondary schools, and again promised to reopen once the guidelines are approved by their leader,"" he said.
In addition, over the last year, the number of community-based education classes taking place in private homes/public places has doubled from 10,000 to 20,000 classes. These serve about 600,000 children, of whom 55 percent are girls, said Abdi.
These positive signs are the results of both commitment from the de facto authorities and pressure from local communities to keep schools and community schools open, he said. ""Without education, certainly there is no hope for a better future for girls and women of Afghanistan.""
Janti Soeripto, president and chief executive officer of Save the Children U.S., called on donor countries not to freeze or withhold humanitarian funding for Afghanistan.
""Donor countries must continue to support a unified, principled response that includes men and women, and refrain from freezing or withholding this flexible funding that we so desperately need. We need the international community to stand by and not give (up) hope on the women, girls and men and boys in Afghanistan,"" she told the press briefing.
If the ban on women's participation in humanitarian work isn't reversed, the consequences for the people of Afghanistan will be dire, and that's the message the mission has taken to the de facto authorities in Afghanistan, she said.
As there has been some progress, her organization is hopeful that discussions across the various provinces to resume its work will continue, said Soeripto.

President Joe Biden's remarks came as debate picked up steam over whether to arm Ukraine, which has been in conflict with Russia for nearly a year, with Western-made fighter jets.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Joe Biden said on Monday that he won't approve sending F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine.
""No,"" Biden said in response to a question about the possibility of such a decision.
As he spoke, Biden arrived back at the White House from a trip to Baltimore, Maryland. Biden also said he was planning to visit Poland but didn't yet know when.
The president's remarks came as debate picked up steam over whether to arm Ukraine, which has been in conflict with Russia for nearly a year, with Western-made fighter jets.
Asked about the administration's decision on potential delivery of F-16s to Ukraine, U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor Jonathan Finer said during an appearance on MSNBC last Thursday that ""we have not ruled in or out any specific systems.""
""We have tried to tailor our assistance to the phase of the fight that the Ukrainians are in. I don't have an announcement to make one way or the other,"" he added.
Albeit a constant request from the authorities in Kiev, fighter jets have long been regarded by the West as a taboo in terms of military assistance for Ukraine, for fear that such deliveries would lead to an uncontrollable escalation of the conflict.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter last Wednesday that securing the provision of Western-type fighter jets are among the ""new tasks ahead"" for Ukraine. On the same day, the United States and Germany announced their respective decisions to send combat tanks to Ukraine.
Ukraine's plea for fighter jets met with refusal from Germany, whose chancellor, Olaf Scholz, recently said combat aircraft is not an item on Berlin's list of weapons for Ukraine.
""The question of combat aircraft does not arise at all,"" Scholz said in an interview with Tagesspiegel published on Sunday. ""I can only advise against entering into a constant competition to outbid each other when it comes to weapons systems.""

GENEVA, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday that the COVID-19 pandemic still constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the WHO's highest alert level.
The announcement came amid the recent increase of weekly reported deaths worldwide. After its quarterly assessment meeting on the COVID-19 pandemic on Friday, the WHO's International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee announced on Monday that COVID-19 continues to constitute a PHEIC, which has been concurred by WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
COVID-19 remains a dangerous infectious disease with the capacity to cause substantial damage to health systems, the committee said in a statement, while acknowledging that the COVID-19 pandemic may be approaching an inflection point.
Although infection or vaccination may lead to higher levels of population immunity globally and limit the impact of morbidity and mortality, ""there is little doubt that this virus will remain a permanently established pathogen in humans and animals for the foreseeable future,"" the committee said.
It then called for long-term public health action that will prioritize the mitigation of COVID-19 impact on morbidity and mortality.
Meanwhile, the committee recommends that countries should achieve 100 percent vaccination coverage of high-priority groups, improve reporting of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance data to the WHO, and ensure long-term availability of medical countermeasures, such as COVID-19 vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics.

Deadly beating of Tyre Nichols yet another grave testament to entrenched racial discrimination in U.S.,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- The video released on Friday night, which captured a violent arrest of an unarmed African American man, stood as another appalling testimony to the lingering spectre over America of racism in policing, triggering protests and inflaming public criticism.
Tyre Nichols, 29, was beaten by police after a traffic stop on Jan. 7 in Memphis, Tennessee, where they allegedly stopped him for reckless driving.
The 29-year-old African American died at a hospital three days after the confrontation, during which Nichols was punched and kicked while being restrained. He pleaded to go home and kept yelling ""mom.""
""What happened here does not at all reflect proper policing. This was wrong. This was criminal,"" said David Rausch, director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, who told reporters on Friday that he saw the video before it was released to the public and found it ""absolutely appalling.""
""What's most shocking about it all is the brutality and then at the end, the complete dehumanization of this man. He's not even human to them -- he's not even a person,"" Randolph McLaughlin, professor at the Elisabeth Haub School of Law and co-chair of the Newman Ferrara civil rights practice, told The Guardian.
The five officers involved in the ferocity were fired after an internal investigation and are facing criminal charges, including second-degree murder.
The incident came nearly three years after the police murder of 46-year-old African American man George Floyd, who died on May 25, 2020 after an encounter with Minneapolis police, during which officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes during a street arrest.
Floyd's death sparked outrage and protests across the United States in the summer of 2020 against police brutality and systemic racism. However, such kind of tragedy continues to unfold in this country, and Nichols' ordeal once again reignited public anger this winter.
Demonstrations have broken out in a series of cities, including Memphis, Washington D.C., New York, Atlanta, and Los Angeles during weekend, demanding justice for Nichols while decrying police violence and racism.
""Shame on this system,"" protesters chanted in downtown Washington D.C., on Friday night.
Analysts said the fact that the five officers are Black in Nichols' case pointed out a systemic problem how people of color are treated regardless of officers' race in the country.
It is the system and the tactics that foster racism and violence, rather than the specific racial identities of officers, said an a New York Times article on Saturday.
Amber Sherman, an activist and organizer working with the Nichols family as they push for policy changes in the police, said that racism is a clear factor in policing when you look at whom the victims of police violence are, not the race of the officers.
Officers of all races ""are indoctrinated into a practice that sees Black people and Brown people as less than,"" Sherman was quoted by the article as saying.
It is not racism but culturism driving this, it is a culture in law enforcement where it is OK to be aggressive to those they are supposed to serve, said Robert Sausedo, the head of Community Build Inc, a Los Angeles-based non-profit organization.
U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement that he was ""outraged and deeply pained to see the horrific video of the beating that resulted in Tyre Nichols' death.""
""It is yet another painful reminder of the profound fear and trauma, the pain, and the exhaustion that Black and Brown Americans experience every single day,"" Biden stressed.
In a joint tweet released on Sunday, Barack and Michelle Obama said that Nichols' death is a ""painful reminder"" for America.
""The vicious, unjustified beating of Tyre Nichols and his ultimate death at the hands of five Memphis police officers is just the latest, painful reminder of how far America still has to go in fixing how we police our streets,"" the couple said.
Police killed 1,186 people in the United States last year, according to Mapping Police Violence. In 2022, 26 percent of those killed by police were African Americans, who account for only 13 percent of the population.

GENEVA, Jan. 29 (Xinhua) -- Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) have denounced the United States for its abusive series of appeals against the global trade watchdog's panel rulings over its import tariffs and flawed labeling of goods origins, urging the country to fulfill its obligations as a WTO member and stop its unilateral and protectionist moves.
At the latest Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) meeting held here on Friday, five WTO members -- China, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, and Hong Kong -- required the plenary meeting to pass five panel rulings regarding duties imposed by the United States on steel and aluminium imports and U.S. origin marking requirement applicable to goods produced in Hong Kong.
Before the meeting, the United States had appealed four panel rulings regarding duties imposed by Washington on imports of steel and aluminum products from China, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey.
The United States had also filed a seperate appeal against another ruling issued last month, in which Washington deliberately mislabeled products made in Hong Kong as ""Chinese-made."" The shift in the origin of those goods to be imported to the United States was ruled ""not justified"" by a DSB panel.
The world's largest economy also declared it would postpone implementing a panel report regarding a dispute initiated by the European Union (EU) targeting U.S. anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of ripe olives from Spain.
ABUSIVE APPEALS
Washington has a long history of trade bullying. Though it used its right of appeal as a WTO member, its action amount ""to effectively blocking"" WTO rulings, according to a statement by the EU on Friday.
The EU noted that the panel reports have been appealed, but these appeals cannot be currently heard by the Appellate Body, given that it cannot function.
Previously, it normally takes three months for the WTO Appellate Body to rule on any appeals it receives. However, the appeal court has halted operation because the United States has blocked the appointment of new judges and required an overall reform.
Therefore, appeals cannot be processed, and related rulings cannot move forward.
Canada noted that since Dec. 11, 2019, the Appellate Body has effectively been non-functioning, according to a statement delivered at Friday's meeting.
The United States tends to appeal every unfavorable panel report and refuse to comply with the results of any proceedings of the DSB, China's Ambassador to the WTO Li Chenggang told a DSB meeting.
""These troubling behaviors of the U.S. have clearly depicted an image of the U.S. as a unilateral bully, a rule breaker and a supply chain disruptor,"" Li said.
So far, 127 WTO members have attempted on 61 occasions to start the selection process for filling vacancies on the Appellate Body. Still, the United States blocked the proposed decision.
Canada stressed in its statement that all parties to the dispute must fulfill their good faith commitment under the Dispute Settlement Understanding by making every effort to find an acceptable solution. In the long run, no member would benefit from a situation where disputes remain unresolved.
It said that a member acting in good faith should find no comfort in an unfair -- and short-term -- advantage that has arisen because of the absence of a functioning Appellate Body.
The EU also encourages all parties to find a solution that preserves the rights of both the complainant and respondent.
PROTECTIONIST MOVES RULED UNJUSTIFIED

In March 2018, the United States began imposing Section 232 duties on steel and aluminum products to protect its domestic industry under the guise of national security.
Given that Washington has exempted 70 percent of its steel imports from the additional duties, the restricted imports only accounted for 5 percent of U.S. steel consumption, in which defense use took only roughly 0.15 percent, Li said at the meeting.
""In other words, Section 232 measures are overwhelmingly protectionist, as its contribution to national security is negligible at best,"" Li noted.
From the outset, the United States deployed these additional duties as an instrument of economic coercion, using them to force other members to enter into quota arrangements or make concessions to the United States in trade negotiations, said the Chinese ambassador.
These measures have been widely opposed, sued by several WTO members and found WTO-inconsistent by all panels. The findings of the panel in this dispute demonstrated once again that a security exception is not a ""safe harbor"" for unilateralism or protectionism, Li added.
Alparslan Acarsoy, Turkish ambassador to the WTO, said at the 15th Trade Policy Review of the United States held on Dec. 2022 that the United States imposed additional tariffs on imported aluminum and steel products, which clearly violates WTO rules.
He urged the United States to cancel the additional tax measures to avoid further damage to the multilateral trading system.
TÃ¼rkiye believes that the United States has systematically and structurally damaged members' confidence in the multilateral trading system, he added.
""Before the panel, the U.S. relied upon Section 232 reports that formed the basis of the measures to argue that the worldwide excess capacity of steel could damage its domestic steel sector such that it would not be able to increase or maintain production of steel required to address national emergencies,"" said Jayant Raghu Ram, a writer with Indian law firm Lakshmikumaran &Sridharan Attorneys, in a recent article. ""This excess capacity, according to the U.S., constituted an 'emergency in international relations.'""
""However, the panel wasted no words in dismantling the U.S. tenuous defense and held that the situation of excess global steel capacity"" did not ""constitute an 'emergency in international relations,'"" Ram said.
On Aug. 11, 2020, the United States required Hong Kong products exported to the United States to be labeled ""Made in China,"" which the WTO ruled in late December 2022 violated the country's obligations under the trade organization's rules.
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government welcomed the ruling.
The ruling has once again confirmed that the United States has disregarded international trade rules, attempted to impose discriminatory and unfair requirements unilaterally, unreasonably suppressed Hong Kong products and enterprises, and politicized economic and trade issues, said Algernon Yau, secretary for commerce and economic development of the HKSAR government, in a statement.
""When President Biden of the less conservative Democratic Party was voted into power in 2020, it was expected that the U.S. government would tone down its nihilistic rhetoric towards the multilateral trading system and withdraw measures that seemingly violate WTO law, most notably the Section 232 measures,"" Ram added.
""However, irrespective of such change in guard, the United States continues to maintain status quo in respect of such measures,"" he said.
""Though the U.S. detraction from the rule of law in the WTO's rules-based system is not unknown or surprising, WTO members may find relief in the fact that the panel has outrightly held these infamous measures as inconsistent with WTO law,"" Ram noted.

India establishes 3 Grievance Appellate Committees to ensure accountability of internet platforms,"NEW DELHI, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government on Saturday established three Grievances Appellate Committees (GAC) that will address users' complaints against social media and other internet-based platforms to ensure accountability of internet platforms.
GAC is based on the recently amended Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, IT Rules 2021 and the committees are composed of three members each.
""The IT rules 2021 provide for creating avenues for grievance redressal apart from courts and ensure that the constitutional rights of Indian citizens are not contravened by any big-tech platform by ensuring new accountability standards for significant social media intermediaries,"" a statement issued by the federal ministry of electronics and information technology said.
According to the ministry, GAC is a critical piece of overall policy and legal framework to ensure that the internet in India is open, safe, trusted and accountable.
""The need for GAC was created due to large numbers of grievances being left unaddressed or unsatisfactorily addressed by internet intermediaries,"" the statement said. ""GAC is expected to create a culture of responsiveness amongst all internet platforms and intermediaries towards their consumers.""
Officials said GAC will be a virtual digital platform that will operate only online and digitally -- wherein the entire appeal process, from the filing of an appeal to the decision thereof, shall be conducted digitally.
""Users will have the option to appeal against decision of the grievance officer of the social media intermediaries and other online intermediaries before this new appellate body. The committee will endeavor to address the user's appeal within a period of 30 days,"" the ministry said.
The GAC will commence operation on March 1.

"Iran's parliament prepares plan for retaliating against Europe for ""meddlesome"" behaviors","TEHRAN, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian lawmaker said on Saturday the country's parliament has drafted a plan for retaliating in the ""harshest possible way"" against Europe's ""meddlesome"" behaviors.
Vahid Jalalzadeh, chairman of the Iranian Parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, made the remarks in an interview with the official news agency IRNA.
He said the plan is aimed at imposing sanctions on the armed forces of some European Union (EU) states as a tit-for-tat measure for their ""interventionist"" behaviors.
Jalalzadeh added that the plan's preparation gained greater momentum following some European states' ""contradictory and meddlesome"" behaviors during the recent ""riots"" in Iran and the European Parliament's adoption of a resolution calling for naming Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) as a ""terrorist"" organization.
He stressed that the plan is ready to be reviewed during an open session of the Iranian parliament.
Jalalzadeh warned Europe against continuing its ""irrational behavior,"" saying the Iranian parliament is closely monitoring the EU Council's behaviors.
If the council gives in to hardliners' demand, the Iranian parliament will immediately adopt the retaliation plan, he added.
On Jan. 19, the European Parliament approved a resolution calling on the EU to designate the IRGC as a ""terrorist group.""

Syria dismisses report on Syrian military's involvement in alleged 2018 chemical attack,"DAMASCUS, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- The Syrian Foreign Ministry on Saturday slammed as ""lacking credibility"" a recent report by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) accusing the Syrian air force of being behind a 2018 alleged chemical attack near the capital Damascus.
In a statement, the ministry listed Syria's own accusations and condemnations in response to the OPCW report, pointing at the possible role of the United States in politicizing and fabricating reports about incidents in Syria.
""The report lacks any scientific and objective evidence, and no sane person or specialist can reach the misleading conclusions of its authors, who neglected the objective observations raised by state parties, experts, academics, and former inspectors from the organization who are known for their experience and knowledge,"" the ministry said.
It urged the OPCW and the UN to assume their responsibilities to preserve the independence, credibility, and future of the OPCW, and not to allow the U.S.-led Western countries to dominate its work and role, or to politicize its tasks and use it as a tool to achieve their political goals.
On Friday, the OPCW Investigation and Identification Team (IIT) issued a report, claiming that ""there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Syrian Arab Air Forces were the perpetrators of the chemical weapons attack on 7 April 2018 in Douma, Syrian Arab Republic.""
It said that during the attack, at least one helicopter of the Syrian ""Tiger Forces"" Elite Unit dropped two yellow cylinders containing toxic chlorine gas on two apartment buildings in a civilian residential area in Douma, killing 43 named individuals and affecting dozens more.
The Syrian government has repeatedly denied previous reports that indicated an involvement of the Syrian military in the alleged attack.

The Green Deal Industrial Plan is designed to ease restrictions on state aid and unlock huge private financing for clean-tech production in the European Union.
BRUSSELS, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on Wednesday unveiled its plan to meet the challenges posed by the United States'(U.S.) Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and keep up with a worldwide race in subsidy schemes for green industries.
Net-zero industries are most important in the fight against climate change, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said when presenting the Green Deal Industrial Plan.
The plan is built on four pillars: a conducive regulatory environment for the net-zero industries, national and EU funding, ensuring proper skills for the green transition and an ambitious trade agenda.
It is designed to ease restrictions on state aid and unlock huge private financing for clean-tech production in the European Union (EU).

To that end, the European Commission will have to consult with EU countries to amend the current state aid framework, including increasing notification thresholds for the support of green investments.
Margrethe Vestager, executive vice president of the Commission and commissioner for competition, cautioned that the proposed amendment should be temporary, well targeted in size and scope, and pending real benefits.
""So it comes with a risk. Some countries will be able to deliver far more money than others,"" said Vestager.
She said the new provisions should match those sectors affected by the IRA -- and those only -- such as batteries for electric vehicles and wind turbines.

EU countries have generally agreed that part of the IRA, Joe Biden's 369-billion-U.S. dollar package, is a threat to the competitiveness of specific key sectors for the green transition of the European industry, according to Vestager.
Faced with the dual challenges of surging energy prices following the Russian-Ukraine conflict and the potential relocation of European green industries induced by the IRA, the EU has chosen to carefully nurture rather than damage its relationship with the U.S..
Von der Leyen argued in her speech on Wednesday that the EU countries ""welcome"" the U.S. bill, and that ""the fight against climate change is a must.""

But she insisted in the meantime that there should be a level playing field in the global competition and in the EU's single market. ""This is so important for us,"" she added.
Von der Leyen said the Commission's proposals would be debated during the EU summit next week.

"Chaos, distrust, frustration -- Three years on, Britain still troubled by Brexit crisis","

The future of the relationship will depend on political will on both sides, which is far from guaranteed, said the UK in a Changing Europe report in January.
LONDON, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- This January, three years after its departure from the European Union (EU) in 2020, Britain still suffers from division with parliament members continuing to pressure the prime minister on Brexit's consequences during their weekly conventions.
""It's clear that Brexit and its hold over British politics remains strong,"" noted Sophie Stowers from the academic network UK in a Changing Europe. ""Britain has been split into two distinct camps: 'Leavers' and 'Remainers'.""
Brexit chaos has showed no sign of stopping. The divorce has turned out to be long and unpleasant, full of quarrels and distrust, both inside Britain as well as between it and the bloc. As much evidence has showed, the British economy has suffered much, and frustration has grown over the unfulfilled promises. Worse yet, no quick solution is in sight.
ECONOMIC TOLL
""There's now a reasonable consensus that the effects of Brexit on the UK economy have been negative,"" Professor Iain Begg from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) told Xinhua. ""It's more an incremental, small, bit-by-bit, drip-by-drip effect on the British economy. But it's mainly been in one direction of being negative.""
Evidence abounds that both households and businesses have been hit hard. Brexit added an average of 210 pounds (258.4 U.S. dollars) to household food bills in the EU over the two years to the end of 2021, and cost British consumers a total of 5.8 billion pounds (7.1 billion dollars) with higher food bills, research from the LSE Centre for Economic Performance showed in December 2022.

""And since low-income households spend a greater share of their income on food than richer families, these Brexit-driven price rises had a proportionately greater impact on the poorest people,"" the study added.
Companies have also felt the blow. Nearly half businesses still found Brexit challenging, while only a third could envisage opportunities materializing from Brexit, a report published by the Institute of Directors in November 2022 showed.
Businesses said that they have lost clients as a result of Brexit, and that they have had to divert supply chains and relocate to the EU to keep trading, said the report, noting that EU firms are pulling out of Britain as an export market because of the barriers.
""Businesses feel they are banging their heads against a brick wall as nothing has been done to help them,"" said Shevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. ""The longer the current problems go unchecked, the more EU traders go elsewhere, and the more damage is done.""
Brexit has inevitably led to tax rises as well, because a slower-growing economy requires higher taxation to fund public services and benefits, said deputy director John Springford at the think tank Centre for European Reform. If Brexit had not happened, he added, most of the tax rises that the government announced in March 2022 would not have been necessary.
A report published by think tank Resolution Foundation in June 2022 found that since 2019, Britain had experienced a sharp decline of 8 percentage points in trade openness, or total trade as a share of GDP. It's estimated that labor productivity will be reduced by 1.3 percent by the end of the decade due to changes in trading rules alone.
While the debate on the impact of Brexit has implied a one-off shock, adjustment will be gradual and create a lasting impact on Britain's competitiveness and productivity over the coming decade, the report noted.
BROKEN PROMISES
One of the illusory promises of Brexit was it would enable Britain to cut quick-and-easy trade deals, but this has not happened with the EU, by far its largest partner, nor with the United States, said John Kampfner from the policy institute Chatham House in a December 2022 article.

""Considerable effort, and resource, has been expended on devising an independent trade policy. Once again, the results are limited,"" Kampfner noted. ""Much of Brexit's Global Britain dream was based on reviving deeper relationships with the Commonwealth. Again, this is proving harder than originally envisaged.""
The reality is that the vast majority of the 71 deals reached since Brexit are rollover agreements with countries that already had trade agreements with the EU, according to researcher Stephen Hunsaker at the UK in a Changing Europe in January. Even though the existing UK-Japan agreement was slightly modified, analysts cautioned that it will provide no net gain compared to the EU-Japan deal, Hunsaker added.
Also, migration was quite a big deal in Brexit debates, but two years on from the end of free movement, the level of net migration certainly has not fallen, said Torsten Bell, chief executive at the Resolution Foundation.
Statistics show net migration continued to add to the population in the year ending June 2022, with an estimated 504,000 more people arriving long-term to the UK than departing.
""EU migration has decreased sharply, while there has been a substantial increase in non-EU migration. Combined with other factors, this has led to migration overall running at record levels,"" said a report published by UK in a Changing Europe in January.
""The new system has seen increases in work visas in the health sector, and some other high-skilled service sectors, while other sectors, such as hospitality, which were previously more dependent on EU workers, are seeing labour shortages,"" it added.
Regrets have been growing. The number of Leave voters who think it was wrong for Britain to vote leave the EU has been steadily increasing since 2021, hitting a record 19 percent in November 2022, YouGov data showed, identifying the top reason as ""just a general sense that things have gotten worse since Brexit.""
Simon Wolfson, chief executive of the retailer Next, called for more foreign workers in Britain during a recent media interview. It is ""not the Brexit I wanted,"" said the Brexit supporter.
CONTINUED CHAOS
A dispute over the Northern Ireland Protocol, the rules governing post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland, has strained Britain's relations with the EU, even stoking worries of a trade war. Tension grew when the British government in June 2022 introduced a bill to unilaterally change parts of the protocol, which the EU said was not acceptable.

Under the protocol, Northern Ireland is part of British customs territory but is subject to the EU's customs code, value-added tax rules and single market rules for goods. However, a de facto Irish Sea border was thus created between the British mainland and Northern Ireland, meaning goods transported to and from Northern Ireland are subject to border controls.
This has elicited firm opposition from Northern Ireland's pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party, which has demanded the removal or replacement of the protocol as a precondition for it to sit in the assembly and form a devolved government. Political chaos has continued.
The British government's approach to resolving the problems with the protocol has been counterproductive and has further undermined trust, said Hilary Benn, the Labour Member of Parliament for Leeds Central, in September 2022.
""One of the most striking features of Brexit is that those who argued most strongly for it appear unwilling to take any responsibility for its consequences. Nowhere has this been demonstrated more clearly than in the case of the Northern Ireland Protocol,"" Benn noted.
More recently, with efforts to heal the rifts, progress was made in Britain-EU talks. Nevertheless, gaps remained, and analysts expect a long road ahead for the two sides to settle their disputes.
The future of the relationship will depend on political will on both sides, which is far from guaranteed, said the UK in a Changing Europe report in January. ""What seems clear, however, is that the relationship is far from settled. Brexit will not be 'done' for a while yet.""

Australian nuclear agency joins search for lost radioactive capsule,"CANBERRA, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- Australia's nuclear regulatory agency has joined the search for a radioactive capsule missing in the outback.
In a statement on Tuesday, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) confirmed that it has started working with authorities in Western Australia (WA) to locate the capsule.
The eight-millimeter caesium-137 capsule, which is part of a gauge used to measure the density of iron ore, was reported missing along a route in remote WA in January, prompting a radiation alert for a large part of the state and an emergency search.
Authorities have started retracing the route of the capsule which went missing while being transported from a mining site to a storage facility in Perth.

"Blinken wraps up visit to Jerusalem, West Bank, with little progress in ending Israeli-Palestinian violence","JERUSALEM/GAZA, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken concluded his visit to Jerusalem and the West Bank on Tuesday, with little progress made in de-escalating the Israeli-Palestinian tensions, experts said.
Blinken's trip, during which he met with leaders of Israel's new right-wing government and the Palestinian Authority (PA), came amid escalating violence between Israelis and the Palestinians.
Since the start of 2023, Israeli forces have killed at least 35 Palestinians, making January one of the most deadly months in the West Bank in recent years. Most casualties occurred during Israeli military raids, which Israel says aimed to detain Palestinian militants.
In retaliation, a shooting attack launched by a Palestinian gunman outside a synagogue in an Israeli settlement in East Jerusalem claimed the lives of seven people on Friday night.
On Monday, Blinken held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem and other senior officials before traveling on Tuesday to the West Bank city of Ramallah to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.
In both places, Blinken urged de-escalating the tensions and renewed the call for a two-state solution to the conflict. ""The rising tide of violence has resulted in the loss of many innocent lives on both sides,"" he told reporters in Jerusalem. ""All sides must take steps to prevent further escalation of violence.""
LITTLE PROGRESS ACHIEVED
The top U.S. diplomat's trip failed to offer any new initiative to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Michael Milshtein, an expert from the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies at the Tel Aviv University, told Xinhua.
Milshtein said the Israeli government was hopeful that Blinken will exert pressure on Abbas to renew the security coordination between the PA and Israel. The PA decided on Jan. 26 to end security coordination with Israel in response to an Israeli military raid in the West Bank city of Jenin, in which Israeli forces killed ten Palestinians.
The security coordination, which is criticized by many Palestinians, has led to the arrests of some Palestinians who were allegedly planning attacks against Israelis.
In a statement issued after meeting with Blinken, Abbas made no indication he was going to resume the coordination. He accused Israel of violating Palestinians' rights, promoting annexation of the West Bank, and demolishing Palestinian homes -- moves that pose further hurdles to achieving a peace deal.
""We have found that the Israeli government is responsible for what's happening these days,"" Abbas said.
Assaf Meydani, a professor at the Lauder School of Government, Diplomacy and Strategy of the Reichman University in Herzliya, told Xinhua that ""negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority in the current situation is impossible, even the United States knows it.""
On the other hand, Blinken's visit also had limited impact on the Israeli side, which has a new hawkish government that is unlikely to dial down its position against the Palestinians.
""The situation inside Israel makes the current government go to more 'extreme' to ensure its survival for the longest possible period, and therefore it will continue to escalate, and in return, there will be a Palestinian reaction,"" said Ghassan al-Khatib, a political science professor at the Birzeit University in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
The visit, which marked the first meeting between Blinken and Netanyahu since the latter returned to office in December as the leader of a new right-wing government, was seen as part of Washington's efforts to navigate through the differences between the Biden administration and the new Israeli government.
His trip followed the visits to Jerusalem by Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and CIA Director William Burns earlier in January.
U.S. ATTENTION OCCUPIED ELSEWHERE
Al-Khatib also noted that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is not a priority for the U.S. as its attention is occupied by ""other internal and external issues.""
The Palestinians have repeatedly called on Washington, as Blinken promised in 2021, to reopen the U.S. consulate for Palestinians in Jerusalem and the PLO office in Washington. They also urged the U.S. to pressure Israel to preserve the status quo in Jerusalem and stop Israeli unilateral measures or withholding Palestinian tax revenue dues.
But the U.S. administration led by President Joe Biden has remained largely acquiescent regarding the escalation of Israeli violence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, while failing to fulfill any of its promises made either during the election campaign or in bilateral meetings with Palestinian officials, analysts noted.
Milshtein said that the U.S. does not prioritize the Palestinian issues anymore, adding the attention of Washington is occupied elsewhere, mainly its internal issues as well as the Ukrainian crisis.
Ziyad Abu Ziyad, a think-tanker and former Palestinian minister, said that the U.S. is not interested in ending the Israeli occupation or the conflicts in the region despite its talk of a two-state solution and positive steps to solve the Palestinian issue.
He added that it's time for anyone who bets on a U.S. solution to the Palestinian issue to ""realize that this was nothing but a mirage.""
The last round of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks ended without progress due to deep differences on several key issues in March 2014, since which Washington has made no real push to renew the stalled peace process despite the recurrent violence and conflicts between the Israelis and Palestinians.

Chinese national killed in gunmen attack in Ethiopia,"ADDIS ABABA, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- One Chinese national has been shot dead by unidentified gunmen in Ethiopia's Oromia region, the Chinese Embassy in Ethiopia confirmed on Tuesday.
The incident happened on Monday evening when nine Chinese nationals were attacked in the Gebre Guracha town in the northern part of the Oromia region, about 160 km from Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. One of them was shot dead eventually, the embassy said in a statement.
Even though large-scale military conflicts have stopped in Ethiopia, ethnic and religious conflicts remain acute in some parts of the country. In the border areas between Oromia and other regions, in particular, armed attacks, kidnappings, robberies and other vicious cases have occurred frequently, causing a large number of casualties and posing high security risks.
The Chinese Embassy in Ethiopia called on Chinese citizens and institutions in the East African country to be vigilant, avoid negligence, build a strong security awareness, stay away from high-risk areas, and not travel to or pass through high-risk areas.

WWII sex slavery victims in Philippines urge Japan to recognize war crimes,"MANILA, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- Surviving Filipino women sexually enslaved by Japan's World War II military on Tuesday urged the Japanese government to acknowledge its war crimes, resolve the ""comfort women"" issue, and stop ""warmongering.""
""It is very unjust on the part of the Japanese government to continue ignoring the issue of Filipino comfort women who have suffered long enough, more than half a century in silence,"" Sharon Cabusao-Silva, the executive director of Lila Pilipina, told reporters.
Lila Pilipina is a Philippine organization helping women forced into Japanese military brothels in their fight for justice. There are only a few survivors, and most are in their 90s and sick.
Silva said Japan must recognize the trauma inflicted on the women by the Japanese Imperial Army.
""We urge Japan to finally acknowledge its war crimes against Asian nations and take the necessary steps toward a fair and long-overdue resolution of the 'comfort women' issue,"" the group said.
Lila Pilipina's call came when Japan was set to present its human rights report for the Fourth Cycle of the United Nations' Universal Periodic Review of Human Rights in the country.
""We are outraged that Japan has chosen to ignore once again the issue of its wartime military sex slavery of thousands of Asian women in the fourth human rights report it submitted to the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC),"" it added.
While declaring its achievements in various human rights areas, the Japanese government was utterly silent about the ""comfort women"" system which is also at the core of these issues, the group said.
The group added Japan ""totally ignored"" the recommendations made by other countries ""for Japan to finally address this long-standing issue.""
The group sounded the alarm over Japan's ""aggressive actions toward war spending and production with the development of its missile and other defense capabilities.""
The group also expressed alarm ""by how Japan has militarized its Official Development Assistance programs in the Philippines through the sale of war material.""
As living witnesses and victims of war, Narcisa Claveria and Estelita Dy said they experienced cruelty and hardships during World War II at the hands of the Japanese military.
""We were abused, forced to wash and iron their clothes by day, and repeatedly raped at night by Japanese soldiers. That is why I reject war,"" Claveria told reporters.
""War is brutal; you will suffer even if you have not done anything wrong because they accuse you of doing something even if you did not,"" she added.
Estelita Dy said the new generation must not experience war. ""We do not want the new generation to experience the atrocities of war; what we went through during the war, so we are against war,"" she told reporters.
During World War II, hundreds of thousands of women and girls from China, the Korean Peninsula, Southeast Asia and other countries and regions were forcibly conscripted by Japanese militarists as sex slaves and experienced horrific sexual violence, both mentally and physically.

Bangladesh raises electricity prices to ease subsidy burden,"DHAKA, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- In an apparent bid to ease the subsidy burden, the Bangladeshi government has again raised the prices of power at both the wholesale and retail levels.
The new rates will come into effect from Feb. 1, 2023, according to a notice from the ministry of power, energy and mineral resources.
The retail price of electricity will be raised by 5 percent for the second time in less than a month while the wholesale prices are seeing an increase of 8.06 percent, according to the notice.
The Bangladeshi government on Jan. 12 raised the electricity price at the retail level by 5 percent to 7.48 taka per unit on a weighted average, ignoring opposition from businesses and consumers.
The move to raise the retail price of electricity on Jan. 12 came after the price was hiked by 19.92 percent at the producers' level in December last year.
Bangladeshi State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid had earlier said that backlog made due to financial losses in gas import would be likely overcome to some extent if the power price adjustment is made on a monthly basis.
Experts claimed the markup in power prices would likely push up the nation's inflation rate again.
Inflation in Bangladesh accelerated to 9.52 percent in August last year, the highest in 10 years, mainly driven by higher food prices, the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics reported. (1 U.S. dollar equals about 100 takas)

"Mass shootings, deadly law enforcement expose U.S. culture of violence","NEW YORK, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- The mass shootings in Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay in California as well as Tyre Nichols' death from deadly law enforcement in Memphis, Tennessee, expose once again the violent root in U.S. culture.
From the astonishing number of people killed every year because of gun violence to deaths due to police's lethal force, these tragedies speaking more than racism, police brutality and control of guns, but a fact that the culture of violence is deeply rooted in the Untied States.
WIDESPREAD VIOLENCE
The state of California has been in sorrow due to a series of deadly shootings recently. On the Eve of the Chinese Lunar New Year, 11 people were killed in a mass shooting in Monterey Park in Los Angeles County. Two days later, another two shootings happened in the coastal northern California city of Half Moon Bay, leaving seven people dead and one critically injured.

The United States has reported 3,507 deaths from gun violence in the first 30 days of 2023 with 51 mass shootings recorded, according to Gun Violence Archive, a website that tracks shootings in the country.
""We have the highest rates of gun deaths in the world. We have more guns than people ... We have more than one gun for every man, woman and child in America. That is insanity,"" Paul Cole Padilla, an educational administrator, told Xinhua.
The over-used violence in the United States can also be seen in its police department.
Tyre Nichols, 29, was beaten by police after a traffic stop on Jan. 7 in Memphis, Tennessee, where they allegedly stopped him for reckless driving. The African American man died at a hospital three days after the confrontation, during which Nichols was punched and kicked while being restrained. He pleaded to go home and kept yelling ""mom.""
""What happened here does not at all reflect proper policing. This was wrong. This was criminal,"" said David Rausch, director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, who told reporters on Friday that he saw the video before it was released to the public and found it ""absolutely appalling.

It is not racism but culturism driving this, it is a culture in law enforcement where it is OK to be aggressive to those they are supposed to serve, said Robert Sausedo, the head of Community Build Inc, a Los Angeles-based non-profit organization.
No race or ethnic group has a monopoly on violence. No group is immune to our society's obsession and love affair with guns. No group is exempt from mental health challenges or despair, said Naomi Ishisaka, The Seattle Times' assistant managing editor.
""We have to talk about this institutionalized police culture that has this unwritten law,"" Ben Crump, the lawyer for Nichols' family, said in a television interview.
""As much as those five officers killed Tyre Nichols, it was the police culture in America that killed Tyre Nichols,"" Crump said, calling for systematic change among all police officers regardless of the color of their skin.
LOOKING THROUGH CULTURAL PRISM
The culture of violence in the United States manifests on various fronts in the society.
America's culture of violence goes deeper than race, and the single-minded focus on race is not helping to resolve some of the problems, said Bill Maher, host of HBO political talk show Real Time.
Speaking on the tragedies from the mass shootings in Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay to Tyre Nichols' death, Maher said ""I guess what I'm asking is America's culture of violence -- it does go deeper than race, right?""

Police officers work on the scene of a mass shooting in Monterey Park, California, the United States, Jan. 22, 2023. (Xinhua)
""And I think this mono-focus we have on race is short-circuiting us trying to fix some of the realer problems,"" Maher added.
""Can American culture rethink itself -- can it transcend its belief that enemies are always out there, needing to be obliterated,"" said Robert C. Koehler, a Chicago-based journalist and nationally syndicated writer, adding that violence presents itself, in people's imaginations, games, movies and defense budget, as consequence-free, instantaneous and necessary.
The culture of violence has intensified since the 1980s and has found a privileged place in the cult of authoritarianism in the United States, said Henry A. Giroux, an American-Canadian scholar and culture critic.
""As society is increasingly militarized under neoliberalism, violence becomes the solution for everything. This is especially dangerous for those individuals who feel isolated and lonely in a society that atomizes everything,"" Giroux said.
American culture of violence is distinct in its scale and nature, noted Steven Beschloss, a U.S. writer, journalist and filmmaker.
Giroux said the ideological and structural conditions that nourish and legitimate violence have to be revealed both in their connections to power and in the systemic unmasking of those who benefit from such death-dealing conditions.
""We have to make sure that the culture not only respects the policy, but the culture respects the community. Policy means nothing if you have a culture that is rotten,"" Crump said.

""Consumer confidence declined in January, but it remains above the level seen last July, lowest in 2022,"" an expert said.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumers rang in the first month of the new year a little less confidently, according to data released on Tuesday.
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell to 107.1 in January, a slight dip from 109 in the month prior.
""Consumer confidence declined in January, but it remains above the level seen last July, lowest in 2022,"" said Ataman Ozyildirim, senior director, economics at The Conference Board. ""Consumer confidence fell the most for households earning less than 15,000 (U.S. dollars) and for households aged under 35.""
The organization's present situation index, a measure of consumers' assessment of labor and business trends, climbed to 150.9 from 147.4 last month.
However, the expectations index, a measure of consumers' short-run views on income, labor and business conditions, fell to 77.8 from last month's 83.4.
All this comes as economists predict a possible recession in this year's second half.
The data was released a day before the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates.

RAMALLAH/GAZA, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to the West Bank prompted outrage among many Palestinians, who demonstrated on Tuesday to express their opposition to the U.S. top diplomat's presence in the Palestinian territory.
The protesters, both in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, raised the Palestinian flags and chanted anti-U.S. slogans, accusing it of being biased toward Israel and all its violations of Palestinian rights.
""The matter is very simple. Blinken came here to pressure the Palestinian leadership to not adopt any decision against the security cooperation with Israel,"" said Nael Salama, who took part in a protest in the West Bank city of Ramallah carrying a banner of ""The U.S. is criminal as long as it supports Israel.""

""We came here to deliver our message to Blinken that he is not welcome in our country as his administration's full bias towards Israel and its practices against the Palestinian people,"" Issam Baker, the coordinator of the national and Islamic forces in Ramallah, told Xinhua.
He emphasized that the U.S. administration used ""double standards"" in dealing with the Palestinian issue, adding that it will ""only lead to further continuation of the cycle of violence.""
Since the start of 2023, Israeli forces have killed at least 35 Palestinians, making January one of the most deadly months in the West Bank in recent years. Most casualties occurred during Israeli military raids, which Israel says aimed to detain Palestinian militants.

In retaliation, a shooting attack launched by a Palestinian gunman outside a synagogue in an Israeli settlement in East Jerusalem claimed the lives of seven people on Friday night.
Ahmed Abu Dalfa, a protester in the Gaza Strip, told Xinhua that Blinken's visit will not bring benefits to the Palestinian people because Washington is ""abandoning"" its promises to Palestine.
Earlier in the day, Blinken held a meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the Palestinian presidential headquarters in Ramallah after his meetings with Israeli leaders on Monday.
Blinken urged both the Palestinians and Israelis to calm tensions while reiterating Washington's ""ironclad"" commitment to Israel's security.
Following his meeting with Blinken, Abbas said that the Israeli government ""is fully responsible for the current tension and violence in the Palestinian territories"" because it has undermined the two-state solution and violated the signed agreements.
Abbas also accused the international community of failing to end Israel's military occupation of the Palestinian territories and its settlement policy in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

China plays crucial role in global fight against COVID-19,"

COVID: No conditions attached when China helps others
For Li Jun, vice-president of the Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine, fighting COVID-19 was a war on two fronts.
In April 2020, after battling an epidemic in his home province, Li led a team of medical experts to Malaysia to share Chinese health workers' firsthand experience in tackling the novel coronavirus.
Scientists and health workers sharing their data and knowledge is one of China's key methods of contributing to the global efforts against COVID-19. China has dispatched 37 expert teams to 34 countries over the past three years, according to the National Health Commission.
""There is a Malaysian proverb that goes, 'Bukit sama didaki, lurah sama dituruni', which translates into, 'Climb the hill together, traverse the ravine together',"" Li said.
""China and Malaysia share a traditional friendship. We felt a strong duty to share our knowledge and help our Malaysian peers control COVID-19 in their home country.""
Li's team presented their insights into treatment and diagnosis plans, hygiene and healthcare for discharged patients and psychological counseling for those infected and their families. ""We wanted to help the Malaysian people combat COVID-19 and help them return to normalcy as soon as possible,"" Li said.
Chinese experts were similarly offering assistance in Iran, Italy, Pakistan, Russia, the Philippines and Peru, as well as countries in Africa, a feat that embodied the vision of building a global community of health for all, according to the Foreign Ministry.
Wang Xiaotao, former director of China International Development Cooperation Agency, said that many countries had donated valuable supplies to China when it was hit hard, and it was heartwarming for China to return the favor.
""Even when facing a serious COVID-19 situation at home, China promptly launched an emergency humanitarian aid effort, the largest of its kind since the nation's founding,"" Wang wrote in an article in Foreign Affairs Journal, which is published by the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.
""The COVID-19 pandemic recognizes no borders and ethnicities. It is a common enemy of humanity and can only be overcome with solidarity and collaboration,"" Wang wrote. ""China will never stand aloof from a friend in need, nor will it attach conditions for selfish gains when extending a helping hand.""
Mi Feng, spokesman for the National Health Commission, said in a news briefing in mid-January that China has promptly shared vital information with the world, and that served as the scientific basis for developing vaccines and diagnosis tools.
These vital pieces of information included confirming the pathogen was a novel coronavirus, sharing the genome sequence of the virus and publishing China's treatment and prevention plans, he said.
China has provided massive quantities of medical supplies for 153 countries and 15 international organizations, Mi said. It also held over 300 exchanges on COVID-19 control measures and medical treatment with over 180 countries and regions and over 10 international organizations.
Mi said that China was the first country to propose the COVID-19 vaccine as a global public good and the first to cooperate in vaccine production with developing countries. He added that China had provided over 2.2 billion vaccines for over 120 countries and international organizations.
""We are willing to continue to work with the international community to jointly tackle the pandemic and better safeguard the health and well-being of people in various countries,"" Mi said.
At the same news briefing, Wu Xi, director-general of the Department of Consular Affairs of the Foreign Ministry, said that China has maintained an open, transparent and responsible attitude when sharing its data with the international community, including holding over 60 technical exchanges with the World Health Organization, five of which were recently held.
On Jan 14, Ma Xiaowei, head of the National Health Commission, spoke with WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus about the COVID-19 situation in China.
The WHO said in a statement that Chinese officials provided it information on the COVID-19 situation in the country and also made the information public through a news conference. The information shared covered a range of topics, including outpatient clinics, hospitalization, patients requiring emergency treatment and critical care, and deaths related to COVID-19 infection in hospitals.
""The WHO will continue to work with China, providing technical advice and support and engaging in analyzing the situation,"" the statement added.
Qian Yuming, an assistant researcher at the Department for International and Strategic Studies of the China Institute of International Studies, said that China has made an ""irreplaceable and irrefutable"" contribution to the global fight against COVID-19 by providing necessary aid and by building confidence and hope.
Last year, the BRICS nations â Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa â launched a new vaccine research and development center to enhance collaboration in the areas to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.
Mikhail Murashko, Russia's health minister, said in a video address to the launch event that the center showcases the BRICS' commitment to assisting the global population and making vaccines more accessible and affordable for developing countries.
Ahmed Ogwell Ouma, acting director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, said that China's collaborations with countries such as Egypt, Algeria and Morocco offered alternative sources of COVID-19 vaccines to people on the African continent, especially at the height of the pandemic in the middle of 2021.
The partnership has enabled the continent to produce the vaccines locally, thus reducing the need for importing and transporting vaccines from outside the continent, he told Xinhua News Agency.
Sergio Held, a journalist based in Colombia, said that Chinese vaccines brought life in Latin America back to normal, as the Rio de Janeiro Carnival in Brazil made a comeback in April 2022 after being canceled the year before due to the pandemic.
Mehmood ul Hassan Khan, executive director of the Center for South Asia &International Studies in Islamabad, Pakistan, said that China's optimization of its COVID-19 control measures will unleash the vitality of its economy and bolster the international community's confidence in its development potential.
""China has proactively facilitated the optimization of the global public health governance,"" he wrote in an article published in People's Daily.

U.S. plans to end COVID emergency declarations in May,"LOS ANGELES, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- The Biden administration announced on Monday it plans to end the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) on May 11.
The COVID-19 national emergency and PHE were declared by the Trump Administration in 2020. They are currently set to expire on March 1 and April 11, respectively.
The Biden Administration's plan is to extend the emergency declarations to May 11, and then end both emergencies on that date, according to a statement of the White House.
The statement came in opposing two House bills that would end the emergency declarations sooner.
The public health and national emergencies have enabled U.S. hospitals to respond more flexibly when faced with patients spikes during COVID-19 surges.
Ending the emergency declaration could have implications for funding for tests and vaccines as well as impact other pandemic-related policies, the National Public Radio (NPR) reported.

Police violence shows racism only getting worse,"
ãã[Cai Meng/China Daily]
As a white police officer in Minneapolis choked George Floyd to death by kneeling on his neck in 2020, the African American cried out ""I can't breathe"" but that didn't move his oppressor one bit.
Worse, even the nationwide protests that followed Floyd's death in the United States could not deter similar crimes from taking place, as police violence claimed another African American, Tyre Nichols, this month. According to a CNN report, Nichols' family attorney claimed he suffered ""extensive bleeding caused by a severe beating"" from five policemen.
On social media platforms, some argue that the Nichols incident does not constitute racism because it was five black policemen who beat him up. However, it only goes to show that colored people, African Americans in particular, suffer discrimination not only from white people, but also from people of the same color.
Racial discrimination is so deeply rooted in US society that it is impossible to end it overnight. Despite the civil rights movement in the 1960s and colored people's rising sense of equality in recent years with the popularity of social media, the status of colored people in the US remains below that of their white counterparts, be it in economy, opportunities, development and everything.
According to the Mapping Police Violence website, of the 1,186 people who lost their lives to police violence in the US in 2022, African Americans accounted for 26 percent, although the community accounts for 13 percent of the country's population. From 2013 to 2022, an African American has faced 2.9 times greater possibility of encountering police violence than a white American.
Fifty-five years ago, renowned civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. was killed in Memphis. Now Nichols, another African American, succumbed to violence in the same city. It is time the US curbed its racial inequality as the number of killings continues to grow.

According to the PHAC, Canada continues to contribute to and assess the global epidemiology of COVID-19, including working with international partners to enhance viral genomic sequencing capacity.
As COVID-19 activity continues and hospitalizations remain elevated in Canada, layers of prevention, including keeping up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations and personal protective practises, remain the best approach to reduce the risk of developing severe illness and limit the burden on the health system, the PHAC said.

Germany drops face mask mandate on long-distance transport,"BERLIN, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- After almost two years, Germany no longer mandates the use of protective face masks on long-distance trains and buses as the COVID-19 pandemic loosened its grip on the country.
The new rule entered into force on Feb. 2. Some of the country's federal states had lifted the mask mandate earlier.
As infection numbers are declining, Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach has brought forward the end of mandatory mask use from April, but continues to recommend voluntary mask use.
Since the beginning of 2023, Germany's COVID-19 incidence has dropped from around 160 cases per 100,000 residents to just 92 on Thursday, according to official figures.
The last remaining measures -- the obligation for infected persons to self-isolate and the mask requirement at healthcare facilities -- are also to be lifted soon.
Meanwhile, German vaccine developer BioNTech is upgrading one of its plants in Marburg, Hesse, at a cost of 40 million euros (43.7 million U.S. dollars) to manufacture its own plasmids for vaccine production, the company announced on Thursday.
Plasmids are ring-shaped DNA molecules that can be used as a central starting material for the production of messenger RNA not only in vaccines against COVID-19 but also in drugs against other infectious diseases and cancer.
""Medical biotechnology is a key technology of the 21st century,"" Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Thursday during his visit to the BioNTech plant, adding that the pandemic had ""proven Germany's capability as a location for innovation and manufacturing of medicines."" (1 euro = 1.09 U.S. dollar)

WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders will deliver the Republican response to U.S. President Joe Biden's State of the Union address next week, Republican leaders said on Thursday.
The announcement was made in a joint statement by U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell.
Sanders, who served as White House press secretary for then U.S. President Donald Trump from 2017 to 2019, was inaugurated as governor of Arkansas last month.
Biden will deliver his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Feb. 7.
This would be Biden's second State of the Union speech and the first before a divided Congress with Republicans taking control of the House of Representatives and Democrats still running the Senate.
Biden, a Democrat, is facing a string of investigations led by House Republicans into his administration and his family.
The State of the Union address is a message from the U.S. president to Congress, usually given in the early months of the year.

DAMASCUS, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- Syria on Thursday rejected a recent report by an intergovernmental chemical watchdog that accuses the Syrian forces of a chemical attack near Damascus in 2018 as ""politicized"" by the United States and its Western allies.
The report by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is used by the United States and its Western allies to justify their attack against Syria launched just days after the alleged chemical attack in the Douma suburb east of Damascus five years ago, Milad Atiyeh, Syria's permanent representative to OPCW, told a press conference in the Syrian capital.
""On 14 April 2018, days after the alleged Douma incident, the United States, Britain and France launched a barbaric attack on Syria under false pretexts and even without waiting for the results of investigations of this incident. Now such countries are investing in this report ... to exert more political pressures, impose more sanctions and embargo on the Syrian people and to prevent Syria from moving on in the reconstruction process,"" he said.
Atiyeh urged the OPCW not to fall under the hegemony of the United States by preserving its neutrality and credibility.
On Jan. 27, the OPCW Investigation and Identification Team issued a report, claiming that there are reasonable grounds to believe the Syrian air forces were the perpetrators of the chemical weapons attack on April 7, 2018 in Douma.
During the alleged attack, at least one helicopter of the Syrian ""Tiger Forces"" Elite Unit dropped two yellow cylinders containing toxic chlorine gas on two apartment buildings in a residential area in Douma, killing 43 and affecting dozens more, according to the report.
The Syrian government has repeatedly denied all reports that involve the Syrian military in the alleged attack.

Radioactive capsule en route to Australia's Perth for safe storage,"SYDNEY, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- The radioactive capsule, which contained 19 gigabecquerels of Caesium-137, is currently traveling from Newman to Perth in a convoy of vehicles, authorities in Western Australia (WA) confirmed on Thursday.
After an operation led by the state's Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES), the tiny capsule - 8 mm high by 6 mm round - remains in a radiation-proof lead container and is being escorted by 14 personnel from DFES, the Australian Defence Force and the Australian Nuclear and Science Technology Organisation.
""There's no chance of escape this time, no matter how bad the vibrations,"" the DFES said in a statement.
The capsule will be stored by WA Health when it arrives in Perth, as the department is the regulatory authority and has a facility to store it safely.
Earlier, mining company Rio Tinto expressed its gratitude to search crews for locating the missing capsule, which was lost in transit from the company's Gudai-Darri iron ore mine in the Pilbara region.
""While the recovery of the capsule is a great testament to the skill and tenacity of the search team, the fact is it should never have been lost in the first place,"" said Rio Tinto Iron Ore Chief Executive Simon Trott.
""We are taking this incident very seriously and are undertaking a full and thorough investigation into how it happened,"" he added.
The company also made it clear that the device involved is an industrial gauge which commonly applies in the mining industry. In this case, it was used to measure iron ore feed in the crushing circuit of the fixed plant.
According to Rio Tinto, the capsule is small, round and stainless steel, and forms part of a level sensor (gauge) that is used in some fixed plant assets.

Terror network involved in Pakistan's deadly mosque bombing: official,"

ISLAMABAD, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani police have found a network of terrorists behind the deadly suicide bombing on a mosque in the northwest Peshawar city of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, a senior police official said on Thursday.
KP Police Chief Moazzam Jah Ansari told a press conference that the police were close to tracing the terror network behind the attack, saying ""we know the people responsible for it. We know the handlers and the operators as well.""
Talking about how the suicide bomber managed to get into the highly sensitive area of the city, Ansari said the attacker was clad in a police uniform, and the personnel at the entrance gate let him in thinking he is associated with the police force.
""At about 12:37 p.m. he (suicide bomber) arrived at the main gate on a motorcycle wearing helmet, came inside, talked to a constable and asked him where the mosque is. This means that the attacker was not aware of the area ... he was given a target and there is an entire network behind him,"" the official said.
He said the head of the suicide bomber and ball bearings used in a suicide jacket have been recovered from the debris of the damaged mosque, adding that 10-12 kg of highly explosive TNT were used in the explosion.
The blast was so powerful that the shockwaves did not find ways to escape, causing the roof of the mosque building crashing down on worshippers, a major reason behind the large number of casualties, he added.
He said the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar faction of the banned Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) is behind the attack according to evidences collected so far.
""The TTP claimed responsibility for the blast for which the reasons are clear. But then they disowned it. It seems that they consulted among the group and realized that they will be criticized for attacking a mosque,"" he said.
On Monday, a powerful blast ripped through a crowded mosque in Peshawar, killing at least 100 worshippers and wounding more than 200 others, according to hospital and police officials.

DAR ES SALAAM, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice President Philip Mpango on Wednesday urged African leaders to demonstrate their leadership by renewing their commitment to ending AIDS in children in the continent by 2030.
Opening the ministerial launch of the Global Alliance to End AIDS in Children by 2030 in Africa at the Julius Nyerere International Convention Center in Dar es Salaam, Mpango said ""we must not remain complacent as 2030 is at our doorstep.""
He thanked the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO), and other international partners for initiating this new alliance that aims to address one of the most evident gaps in the fight against AIDS.
Twelve African countries have joined the alliance in the first phase. They are Angola, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.
Representatives from the 12 African countries committed themselves and laid out their plans to end AIDS in children by 2030 as international partners set out how they would support countries in delivering on those plans, which were issued at the first ministerial meeting of the Global Alliance to end AIDS in children in Montreal in Canada in Aug. 2022.
""This meeting has given me hope. An inequality that breaks my heart is that against children living with HIV, and leaders today have set out their commitment to the determined action needed to put it right,"" said Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAIDS.
""We cannot let children continue to be left behind in the global response to HIV and AIDS. Governments and partners can count on UNICEF to be there every step of the way,"" said UNICEF Associate Director Anurita Bains.
The Global Alliance to End AIDS in Children by 2030 in Africa is aimed at advocating and mobilizing political commitment and resources to ensure action and accountability around shared targets and commitments.
According to the UNAIDS fact sheet, currently around the world, a child dies from AIDS-related causes every five minutes. The fact sheet also says 160,000 children were infected with HIV in 2021.

STOCKHOLM, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- Finland remains determined to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) together with Sweden, visiting Prime Minister Sanna Marin said when she met her Swedish counterpart here on Thursday.
They also discussed Sweden's current Presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU) and the security situation.
""Last spring, we started our common path to join NATO. This journey must be made hand in hand and in common accord, just like we started it,"" Marin said in a joint press conference with Sweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson.
Marin's remark came three days after Trkiye's foreign minister said that his country could evaluate Finland's NATO bid separately from Sweden's to distinguish ""between a problematic country and a less problematic one.""
The issue became no less topical after Finnish newspaper Ilta-Sanomat reported on the result of a poll showing that the majority of Finns were ready to join NATO without Sweden, Swedish Television (SVT) reported on Thursday.
Asked by a reporter about the result of the poll, Marin reiterated that Finland intends to join NATO together with Sweden.
""I think it is very important that we today send a very clear message: Finland and Sweden applied together, and it is in everybody's interest that we join NATO together,"" Marin said.
At a press conference in Ankara on Monday, Jan. 30, Trkiye's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said that although the two Nordic countries had requested to join NATO together, Finland had taken some steps, while there were ""provocations"" in Sweden.
Among other things, Trkiye has objected to a demonstration in Stockholm, where a copy of the Quran was burnt outside the Turkish Embassy.
Trkiye has also postponed a trilateral meeting with Sweden and Finland on their NATO bids.

Nearly 90 percent of the world's wetlands have been degraded or lost, Mumba said, ""meaning we are losing wetlands three times faster than forests.""
GENEVA, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- The rapid loss of the world's wetlands must urgently be reversed by restoring vital ecosystems, the head of the Convention on Wetlands said here on Thursday.
Awareness on the issue must also be raised, Musonda Mumba, secretary general of the Convention on Wetlands, said on the occasion of World Wetlands Day.
Nearly 90 percent of the world's wetlands have been degraded or lost, Mumba said, ""meaning we are losing wetlands three times faster than forests.""
""There is an urgency to raise global awareness on wetlands to arrest and reverse their rapid loss, and encourage actions to restore and conserve these vital ecosystems,"" she emphasized.

The world only has seven years left to meet the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, she added.
The Convention called on individuals to make conscious choices to minimize their own impact on wetlands, to educate and activate others to get involved in wetland restoration, and join wetland restoration efforts locally.
Mumba recommended that governments and other stakeholders should create a national inventory of wetlands, set specific targets for wetland restoration, and promote good management practices.

Wetlands support critical ecosystems and biodiversity on earth, since 40 percent of all plant and animal species live or breed in wetlands. They are also vital to human life, as wetlands are not only crucial to agriculture and fisheries, but also act as water sources and purifiers, and protect our shores. In addition, wetlands are the planet's greatest natural carbon stores.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- A funeral service for Tyre Nichols, who died last month after being beaten by police officers, was held in Memphis, in the southeastern U.S. state of Tennessee, on Wednesday afternoon.
Nichols, a 29-year-old African American man, was pronounced dead in hospital on Jan. 10, three days after a traffic stop by Memphis police.
Footage released by Memphis authorities last week showed officers brutally punching and kicking Nichols even when he was subdued.
U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris told Nichols' family at the funeral service on Wednesday that Americans ""mourn with you"" while calling for police reform.
American civil rights figure Al Sharpton delivered the eulogy for Nichols, saying that they will continue to fight for justice and ""won't stop until we hold you accountable and change the system.""
Five Memphis police officers involved in the death of Nichols were fired after an internal investigation and are facing criminal charges, including second-degree murder.
The Memphis Police Department's so-called SCORPION unit, to which the fired officers belonged, has been permanently deactivated. The fallout has also reached other agencies, including the Memphis Fire Department, which fired three emergency medical technicians. Two additional Memphis police officers have recently been relieved of duty.
""My brother was robbed of his life, his passions, and his talents, but not his light,"" Keyana Dixon, a sister of Nichols, said on Wednesday.
""I see the world showing him love and fighting for his justice,"" Dixon said through tears. ""But all I want is my baby brother back.""

The death of Nichols came nearly three years after the police murder of African American man George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Floyd, 46, died on May 25, 2020, after an encounter with Minneapolis police, during which white officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes while making an arrest with other colleagues.
The police killing of Floyd sparked outrage and protests across the United States in the summer of 2020 against police brutality and systemic racism.
Police killed 1,186 people in the United States last year, according to Mapping Police Violence. African Americans were 26 percent of those killed by police in 2022 despite accounting for only 13 percent of the population.

Russia denounces U.S. for undermining New START treaty,"MOSCOW, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States, by its actions, has undermined the principles of implementing the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Wednesday.
Zakharova made the remarks at Sputnik Radio in response to the U.S. allegation that Russia violated the New START.
She said that Moscow remains committed to the treaty but does not see the same commitment from Washington.
""Do I need to remind, within the framework of the indivisibility of security, cooperation and everything written here, how the United States unilaterally withdrew from a huge number of agreements, how they were engaged in the so-called containment of Russia behind its back?"" She asked.
The New START, the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty in force between the two nuclear superpowers, can be extended by a maximum of five years with the consent of the two countries. Russia and the United States officially extended the treaty by five years on Feb. 3, 2021.

Missing radioactive capsule found in Australian outback after 6-day search,"SYDNEY. Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- Authorities in the Western Australia state (WA) confirmed that the tiny silver capsule, which contained the radioactive substance Caesium-137, was found and safely controlled at about 11:00 a.m. local time on Wednesday.
""We successfully retrieved the radioactive capsule after searching hundreds of kilometers in the outback and the metro area over the last six days. The capsule was located just south of Newman on the Great Northern Highway. It was two meters from the side of the road,"" said Darren Klemm, Fire and Emergency Services commissioner.
Klemm told reporters that the vehicle was traveling at 70 km/h when specialist equipment picked up radiation emitted from the capsule, and the search team then used portable detection equipment to locate the capsule.
""The Australian Defence Force is currently verifying the capsule using its serial number. A 20-meter hot zone has been set up around the capsule and it will be placed into a lead container to shield from radiation. It will be stored in a secure location in Newman tonight before being transported to a WA Health Facility in Perth tomorrow,"" Klemm said.
Authorities had warned that the capsule posed a significant public health risk, warning that anyone who came too close or touched it without protection could suffer from radiation burns or sickness.
""Once the capsule has been secured, we will survey the site to ensure there is no contamination in the surrounding area,"" said Klemm.
""In extremely unlikely circumstance that the capsule leaks we will remediate the area.""
Following that, the emergency services updated its public warning, saying that the radioactive substance in parts of Pilbara, Midwest Gascoyne, Goldfields-Midlands and Perth Metropolitan regions is controlled and contained.
According to the emergency department, the 6 mm by 8 mm capsule was packaged on Jan. 10 to be sent to Perth for repair before leaving the site for transport by road on Jan. 12.
The package holding the capsule arrived in Perth on Jan. 16 and was unloaded and stored in the licensed service provider's secure radiation store.
On Jan. 25, the gauge was unpacked for inspection. Upon opening the package, it was found that the gauge was broken apart with one of the four mounting bolts missing and the source itself and all screws on the gauge also missing.
Mining company Rio Tinto on Sunday apologized for losing the capsule and launched an investigation over the incident.
""We are taking this incident very seriously. We recognize this is clearly very concerning and are sorry for the alarm it has caused in the Western Australian community,"" said Rio Tinto Iron Ore Chief Executive Officer Simon Trott.
In an article published in the Conversation, Edward Obbard, senior lecturer in nuclear engineering from the University of New South Wales, noted that Caesium-137 is a dangerous but useful radioactive isotope that spits out electrons (or beta radiation) and high-energy photons (or gamma radiation), which can be used in some cancer treatments, for measuring the thickness of metal or the flow of liquids, and for calibrating radiation gauges.
The missing capsule has a radioactive load of 19 giga-becquerels, which means it emits about 19 billion high-energy photons per second, said the scholar, warning that the most danger would occur if the capsule was broken open.
""Caesium-137 has a half-life of just over 30 years, which means the source's radiation output will halve every 30 years until it disappears completely,"" said Obbard.

Guilty of innocence: Western smear campaign against China exposed,"BEIJING, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- ""The mainstream media and quite a number of politicians and governments intimidate us daily that China's rise poses a threat to the rest of the world and especially to the West,"" said veteran Spanish journalist Javier Garcia in his new book ""China, Threat or Hope. The Reality of a Pragmatic Revolution.""
""China is not a threat at all,"" Garcia said in an interview with Xinhua, noting that the country has become the second world economic power ""without practically firing a single shot, without violence, without wars, without colonialism.""
SMEAR CAMPAIGN
For the former delegate of EFE, the leading news agency in Spanish, in the Middle East, Venezuela, Germany and China, the supposed ""China Threat"" theory is nothing more than a systematized U.S. trick to contain the peaceful rise of the Asian country, which for Washington means a great challenge to its hegemony.
""The U.S. refuses to accept that its days to maintain the world hegemonic dominance are numbered,"" Garcia said in the book, which was published by Ediciones Akal.
Washington, he said, has launched a ""hybrid war"" like ""an octopus with multiple tentacles"" in the economic, commercial, technological, scientific, political, health and media sectors, combined with intelligence and espionage operations, destabilization campaigns in regions such as Xinjiang, support for separatism in Hong Kong or Taiwan, and military intimidation along China's coast.
Among the multiple battlefronts, Garcia said he is very familiar with the smear campaign against China orchestrated by the Western media that ""set the agenda and the tone about China"" so that the rest of the Western press follows them ""mostly without reservations.""
In his work, Garcia listed the ""arsenal of words"" aimed at instilling fear in anything related to China and reinforcing the negative image installed in the heads of readers, manipulating the terms like ""regime,"" ""purge,"" ""propaganda"" and ""repression"" or expressions like ""power struggles,"" ""under threat"" and ""debt trap.""

Photo taken on Aug. 4, 2022 shows the White House and a stop sign in Washington, D.C., the United States. (Xinhua/Liu Jie)
In this sense, the rich in the United States are millionaires or great entrepreneurs, while those in China are oligarchs; China does not fire corrupt or inefficient officials, but rather ""purges"" them; China does not grant advantageous loans to develop infrastructure in poor countries, but ""traps"" them in debt; China adopts ""vaccine diplomacy,"" and other countries donate them selflessly; China ""monitors and controls"" close contacts of COVID cases, and other countries trace them.
According to Garcia, the Western media have even created a universal rhetoric of ""at what cost,"" in order to seek in any case the negative consequence of positive news about China, such as ""the Chinese economy grows, but at what cost""; ""Chinese cities are getting smart, but at what cost""; ""China provides abundant snow for the Olympic Games, but at what cost""; ""clean air, at what cost?""; ""Wuhan is safe from Covid, but at what cost""; ""China invests in Ethiopia, but at what cost""; ""China boosts Cambodia's economy, but at what cost""; etc.
One of the most ""curious"" examples is that Bloomberg reported in December 2019 that ""China cures cancer faster and cheaper than anyone else, but some worry it's too fast.""
Garcia explained that the U.S. media is those who set the tone, and it is really very difficult for other Western media to get out of that way, since they are very much influenced by the former.
A DIVERSE, FASCINATING COUNTRY
The journalist took advantage of his stay of more than four years in China to observe the country closely. With an independent approach, he has found an authentic China which is totally different from the one described by the Western media.
""The truth is that China surprised me. It is a very different country, very diverse, very developed in certain things. It is a fascinating country and has many things that one does not expect what life is like in the country,"" said the writer. ""I tried to arrive in the country freeing myself from all prejudices and with the most open mind possible.""
While working as a reporter, Garcia met Ding Yan, 34 years old, who told him how her life had changed, from her childhood years in the countryside without running water or electricity, to studying at the university, receiving a degree in philology and settling into a city with access to top-quality public services.

This photo taken on Dec. 8, 2022 shows the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., the United States. (Xinhua/Liu Jie)
""When you start talking to people, you realize the changes in China. The change that this generation has experienced in the last 20 or 30 years is impressive,"" he said.
Ordinary citizens brimming with joy and placidity deeply moved the then EFE delegate in Beijing, who felt, at the same time, tired of the incessant disinformation of the Western media against China.
As a result, Garcia decided in September 2021 to quit journalism after more than 30 years in the profession, because ""the embarrassing information war against China has taken away a good dose of my enthusiasm for this profession.""
For Garcia, the much-touted Western totem of ""free press"" boils down to ""saying exactly the same thing,"" ""sticking to the script,"" and ""emphasizing over and over again how bad communism is,"" since anyone who steps off the path set by the U.S. State Department and the U.S. media ""will be sidelined.""
After submitting his resignation, Garcia began to write a book about an authentic China, because, in his opinion, ""many things about China are not known, and some key issues, which are very important to the world, are also not known because the readers are not informed.""
HOPE FOR MULTIPOLAR WORLD
The author traveled to various regions, provinces and cities in China, such as Xinjiang and Shenzhen, to see firsthand the topics he was curious about. Regarding the alleged genocides in Xinjiang, Garcia said such accusations are solely based on data collected from the Internet and ""not based on any real situation or field work.""
""In Xinjiang, the Uygur culture is respected. The Uygur language is taught in schools and used in local media. The Uygur population has grown by 16 percent in the last ten years, which is three times more than the national population growth,"" he said.
When asked about Chinese measures against COVID-19, Garcia said that ""there have not been human rights violations at all"" and that the recent optimization of its COVID response has come at a time when the virus is less aggressive and the danger of death is significantly reduced.
""If we consider that the priority of any government should be to save the lives of its population, of its inhabitants, Chinese policy has clearly been effective. There have been far fewer deaths in China than in Western countries and, above all, than in the United States,"" he said.
With regard to the fight against poverty, the author believed that it is the main concern of all citizens of the world. Official data showed China has lifted some 770 million rural residents out of poverty during the past 40 years, accounting for over 70 percent of global poverty reduction.

On the ecological issue, Garcia was aware that the world has ""the image of China as a very polluting country,"" however, in his investigation he concluded that ""it is just the opposite.""
""China has totally changed its economic development model, it has gone from a development model focused on growth above all else, regardless of the consequences, to a much greener one, to one that has a lot of consideration for the environment,"" he said.
He said that China ""is undergoing an energy transformation and has become a leader in renewable energy, electric mobility, electric cars, reforestation, with sponge city projects as an example.""
Garcia attributed the admirable achievements to the ""pragmatic revolution"" led by the Communist Party of China (CPC) and described the way of doing politics as very ""characteristic of the Chinese style.""
""The CPC experiments with different solutions for any problem that arises, launches pilot projects in different cities on measures that it wants to apply, and experiments with them. Those that work best will be adopted and those that do not go well are rejected,"" Garcia explained.
In Garcia's opinion, China is not a threat, but rather the hope for a multipolar world in which everyone can live much more peacefully, trading with the rest of the globe, dedicating their energies and resources to improving the lives of their population instead of to the enrichment of a few, and exchanging goods, knowledge and culture, instead of weapons and bombs.
""China has no intention of imposing its vision on others"" and stands ready to live with all nations in a multipolar world, a more peaceful,more just and better world, Garcia said.

West implements price caps on Russian oil products as Moscow vows to safeguard interests,"BEIJING, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- The implementation of further price caps for seaborne Russian petroleum products, adopted Saturday by the European Union (EU) and the Group of Seven, began Sunday, despite Russia's vow to take measures to protect its interests.
The price cap for ""premium-to-crude"" petroleum products, such as diesel, kerosene and gasoline, is set at 100 U.S. dollars per barrel, while the cap for ""discount-to-crude"" petroleum products, such as fuel oil and naphtha, is set at 45 dollars per barrel, the European Commission said in a press release.
It includes ""a 55-day wind-down period"" for seaborne Russian petroleum products purchased above the price cap, provided it is loaded onto a vessel at the loading port before Feb. 5, 2023, and unloaded at the final port of destination before April 1, 2023, the commission added.
Meanwhile, the EU's ban in June 2022 on imports of Russian petroleum products also took effect Sunday.
The Kremlin warned Friday of a ""further imbalance"" in global energy markets. ""Naturally this will lead to a further imbalance of the international energy markets, but we are taking measures to hedge our interests against the risks associated,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
In December 2022, the EU placed a price cap of 60 U.S. dollars per barrel on Russian seaborne crude oil, a move adopted by the Group of Seven.
Under the price cap, insurance, finance and other services for Russian oil shipments will be banned if oil sells for more than 60 U.S. dollars a barrel.
In response, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Dec. 27, 2022, announcing countermeasures to the price ceiling on Russian oil.
According to the decree, the supply of Russian oil and petroleum products to foreign legal entities and individuals will be banned if a price cap is directly or indirectly stipulated in the contracts.
The Russian president could grant special permission to deliver oil and petroleum products otherwise prohibited under the decree.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden announced Friday an additional round of security assistance for Ukraine with a total value of 2.2 billion U.S. dollars.
The latest package was divided into two parts - 425 million dollars through the Presidential Drawdown Authority, and 1.75 billion dollars from the congressionally-approved Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, according to a statement from the Defense Department.
What's particularly noticeable in the materiel are long-range rockets for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS missile launchers that the United States have provided for Ukraine.
The new rockets are GPS-guided Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bombs (GLSDB) with a range of roughly 90 miles, more than doubling the 40-mile range that previous U.S.-provided HIMARS-compatible missiles have.
The GLSDB's range, however, falls short compared to that of the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), which has long been sought by Ukraine but refused by the United States for fear of escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The ATACMS has a range of nearly 200 miles.
The U.S. government will contract with weapons manufacturers to provide the GLSDB, as well as two HAWK air defense firing units and unspecified ""equipment to integrate Western air defense launchers, missiles, and radars with Ukraine's air defense systems."" That means it will be months away from the actual delivery of these weapons.
The United Sates has committed more than 29.3 billion dollars in security assistance for Ukraine since the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out nearly a year ago, according to the Pentagon's statement.

Global vaccine accessibility urged as Western countries ditch expired doses,"LONDON, Feb. 4 (Xinhua) -- As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose a threat to global public health, the World Health Organization (WHO) last month calls for the momentum for vaccination to be maintained to better cover high-priority groups.
The vaccine uptake in low- and middle-income countries is still insufficient, which became a concern about the ongoing risk, according to the WHO.
The world has been struggling to tackle the problem of unequal distribution of COVID-19 vaccines between rich and lower-income countries. Yet, years after the outbreak of the pandemic, promises made by many rich countries have yet to be delivered.
""No one is safe until everyone is safe,"" said Seth Berkley, CEO of the global vaccine alliance Gavi.
EMPTY PROMISES
According to figures from Our World in Data, as early as two years ago, developed countries had already acquired enough doses to vaccinate their population more than one shot for each. But even now, many Western developed countries have not yet fulfilled their promises to deliver vaccines to low-income countries.
There are currently nearly 400 million doses of vaccines announced by the United States but not yet donated, according to the data. For the United Kingdom and Switzerland, the number is 41 million and 6.2 million.
Commenting on the low vaccination rates in low-income countries, Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, told Xinhua in an earlier interview that ""the delay in vaccines getting to them has really been intolerable.""
Last month at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2023 in Davos, Switzerland, Hatchett urged countries and manufacturers to prioritize vaccine supply to the global program COVAX.
VACCINES DESTROYED
According to a report by qz.com last October, Canada destroyed nearly 14 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses in early 2022. Switzerland was also reported to destroy more than 14 million doses of vaccines, which was more than four times the doses it donated to low-income countries.
What also worsened the global accessibility of vaccines is that some low-income countries had to turn down the offering of vaccine doses that were due to expire soon, or had to destroy such doses.
In May 2021, Malawi destroyed nearly 20,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines, which arrived in the country at the end of March but would expire on April 13.
In an article published in the Sunday Mirror newspaper in 2021, WHO Ambassador for Global Health Financing Gordon Brown said the West's stockpile of COVID-19 vaccine is growing by the day but many poorer parts of the world are missing out.
""We must act now,"" said the former British prime minister.
IMMUNITY GAP
The obvious gap between immunity in rich and poorer countries has drawn the attention of many experts. Many have warned that the longer the unequal vaccine distribution exists, the wider COVID-19 spreads, and new variants are more likely to emerge.
Extremely unequal vaccine distribution has typified the availability of vaccines across countries, said a study published in August 2022 in the UK journal Communications Medicine. ""In an unequal world with open economies, pandemics do not stop at national borders,"" it stressed.
Since about 85 percent of the global population resides in low- and middle-income countries, most of humanity remains exposed to continued outbreaks, the study said, adding that this situation increases the risk that further virus variants will emerge, possibly undermining the efficacy of existing vaccines.
Most people in the world's poorest countries might not have access to COVID-19 vaccines until at least mid-2023, it said.
""We will only prevent variants from emerging if we are able to protect all of the world's population, not just the wealthy parts,"" said Berkley.
As long as large portions of the world's population are unvaccinated, variants will continue to appear, and the pandemic will continue to be prolonged, he said.

"U.S. stocks drop, oil prices fall as strong U.S. jobs report prompts rate concerns","NEW YORK, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- A stronger-than-expected U.S. employment situation report weighed on markets Friday, causing both the U.S. stocks and oil prices to end noticeably lower.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 127.93 points, or 0.38 percent, to 33,926.01. The S&P 500 sank 43.28 points, or 1.04 percent, to 4,136.48. The Nasdaq Composite Index shed 193.86 points, or 1.59 percent, to 12,006.95.
All the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in red, with consumer discretionary and communication services down 3.11 percent and 2.22 percent, respectively, leading the slide.
Sentiment on the oil market was also dented with both the U.S. and the global crude benchmarks falling to their multi-week lows.
The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for March delivery dropped 2.49 U.S. dollars, or 3.28 percent, to settle at 73.39 dollars a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest finish since Jan. 4.
Brent crude for April delivery lost 2.23 dollars, or 2.71 percent, to close at 79.94 dollars a barrel on the London ICE Futures Exchange. That was the lowest settlement since Jan. 9.
The above market reactions came as a strong January U.S. jobs report prompted concerns over higher rates.
U.S. employers added 517,000 jobs in January, crushing estimates, the Labor Department reported on Friday. The huge job growth was compounded by a new low in the unemployment rate, which fell from 3.5 percent to 3.4 percent, a new 54-year low.
Neither the markets nor the Federal Reserve had anticipated such strong jobs data, Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial, said in a note on Friday. On the side of the Fed, ""a super-tight labor market is the most compelling reason to keep hiking rates,"" he said.
The Fed on Wednesday raised interest rates by 25 basis points, boosting the target range for the federal funds rate to 4.5-4.75 percent, as it continued its fight against inflation.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed recognizes that the pace of inflation has eased, but ""it would be very premature to declare victory.""
Powell said that with the labor market still tight, he expects ""ongoing"" increases to get monetary policy ""sufficiently restrictive"" to engineer a more balanced job market and bring down too-high inflation.
He referred to a ""couple more"" rate hikes, giving the impression that the cycle is drawing closer to the end.
""Markets are interpreting Wednesday's FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting in a dovish light,"" but ""the Fed's comments also contained plenty of more hawkish elements,"" UBS analysts said on Friday.
The Fed remains concerned about the risk of doing too little, they noted, adding that ""we continue to believe that markets have moved too far and too fast in pricing a dovish pivot in Fed policy.""
For the week, the Dow slipped nearly 0.2 percent, the S&P 500 gained 1.6 percent and the Nasdaq rose 3.3 percent.
For oil, the WTI logged a weekly drop of 7.9 percent, while Brent declined 7.5 percent for the week, based on the front-month contracts.

NATO urges Russia to respect nuclear pact with U.S.,"BRUSSELS, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on Friday called on Russia to respect its treaty with the United States on nuclear weapons, which contributes to international stability.
NATO ambassadors said in a statement that ""We note with concern that Russia has failed to comply with legally-binding obligations under the New START Treaty.""
The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) was signed by Russia and the United States in 2010. The last remaining nuclear arms control treaty in force between the two nuclear superpowers can be extended by a maximum of five years with the consent of the two countries. Russia and the United States officially extended the treaty by five years on Feb. 3, 2021.
The ambassadors said that Russia's refusal to hold consultations or to allow U.S. inspections since last August ""prevents the United States from exercising important rights under the treaty, and undermines the United States' ability to adequately verify Russian compliance with the treaty's central limits.""
""We call on Russia to fulfil its obligations under the treaty by facilitating New START inspections on Russian territory, and by returning to participation in the treaty's implementation body,"" NATO said.
Earlier this week, Moscow accused the United States of undermining the principles of implementing the treaty. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said that Moscow remains committed to the treaty but does not see the same commitment from Washington.

Kishida, who has recently expressed caution over legalizing same-sex marriage, told reporters that he took the issue ""very seriously"" and that Arai's successor has already been decided.
""Executive secretary Arai's remarks totally contradict the government's policy and are inexcusable,"" said the prime minister.

Arai also said that if same-sex marriage is introduced in Japan, it would ""change the way society is"" and that ""there are quite a few people who would abandon this country.""
Arai quickly retracted the comments on Friday after they were made public by the media and apologized, adding that the remarks did not reflect Kishida's own thinking.
Arai, 55-year-old, was appointed an executive secretary to the prime minister in October 2021, when the Kishida administration took office, from his post as director-general of the commerce and information policy bureau at the METI.

The price cap for ""premium-to-crude"" petroleum products, such as diesel, kerosene and gasoline, is set at $100 per barrel, while the cap for ""discount-to-crude"" petroleum products, such as fuel oil and naphtha, is set at $45 per barrel, the EC has said.
The price caps will be implemented from Sunday, the EC has said, adding that it includes ""a 55-day wind-down period"" for seaborne Russian petroleum products purchased above the price cap, provided it is loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading prior to Feb 5, 2023 and unloaded at the final port of destination prior to April 1, 2023.
Meanwhile, the EU's ban in June 2022 on import of Russian petroleum products will also take effect on Sunday.
In December 2022, the EU placed a price cap of $60 per barrel on Russian seaborne crude oil, which was joined by the G7.
In December, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree banning supplies of Russian oil and petroleum products if contracts directly or indirectly provide for a price cap, Sputnik reported.

"U.S. long-arm jurisdiction harms int'l order, rule of law","BEIJING, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States has a longstanding practice of exerting frequent long-arm jurisdiction over other countries, which severely harms the international political and economic order and the rule of law.
In essence, long-arm jurisdiction is an arbitrary judicial practice wielded by the U.S. government on the strength of the U.S. hegemony to enforce extraterritorial jurisdiction over entities and individuals of other countries on the ground of its domestic law.
In line with international law, the exercise of a country's jurisdiction over an extraterritorial person or entity generally requires that the person or entity or its conduct has a real and sufficient connection to that country. Yet the United States exercises long-arm jurisdiction on the basis of the ""minimum contacts"" rule, constantly lowering the threshold for application.
Meanwhile, to exercise long-arm jurisdiction, the U.S. government has further developed the ""effects doctrine,"" meaning that jurisdiction may be exercised whenever an act occurring abroad produces ""effects"" in the United States, regardless of whether the actor has U.S. citizenship or residency, and regardless of whether the act complies with the law of the place where it occurred.
Long-arm jurisdiction has become a means by which the United States abuses unilateral sanctions, especially secondary sanctions. According to the Treasury 2021 Sanctions Review, by fiscal year 2021, the number of active U.S. sanctions designations had increased to more than 9,400.
U.S. sanctions have strained relations between countries and undermined the international order. So far, the ""long arm"" of U.S. jurisdiction has reached China, Russia, Iran, Syria, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Cuba, France, Britain, Germany, Japan, among others.
Long-arm jurisdiction has become a tool for the U.S. authorities to interfere with normal international commercial exchanges and competition.
In 2013, in order to beat Alstom in their business competition, the United States applied the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to arrest and detain then Alstom's senior manager Frederic Pierucci on charges of bribing foreign officials. He was further induced to sign a plea deal and provide more evidence and information against his company, leaving Alstom no choice but to accept General Electric's acquisition, vanishing ever since from the Fortune 500 list.
In an article published in Foreign Affairs magazine, Professor Daniel Drezner of Tufts University criticized successive U.S. administrations for abusing economic coercion and economic violence, and using sanctions as the preferred solution to diplomatic problems, which have been causing humanitarian disasters.
When COVID-19 was raging across the world, the U.S. government did not relent in imposing unilateral sanctions on Iran, Syria and other countries, making it difficult for these countries to obtain the much-needed medical supplies to fight the virus. As a result of the sanctions, Iran has been cut off access to essential medicines and medical equipment, putting the health of millions of Iranians in jeopardy.
Long-arm jurisdiction not only undermines the principle of sovereign equality, violates international law, and erodes the multilateral order with the United Nations at its core, but also creates and intensifies tensions and conflicts among major countries, and poses a threat to the international security system established after World War II. It also interferes with and distorts normal international commercial exchanges and trade order, disrupts the supply chain of global trade, damages the interests of enterprises and raises their operating costs.
The United States should renounce its illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction measures, and truly take up its international responsibilities as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.

U.S. technological hegemony reveals foul imperialist mentality,"

BEIJING, Feb. 4 (Xinhua) -- The harsher export restrictions that the United States intends to impose on the Chinese tech firm Huawei reveal nothing but its zero-sum and foul imperialist mentality.
Such vile moves would certainly disrupt global industrial and supply chains, causing harm to all parties involved.
The U.S. administration has stopped providing U.S. companies with licenses to export to Huawei and is pushing a deal with Japan and the Netherlands for them to impose new restrictions on exports of chip-making tools to China, according to recent reports by international media outlets.
This is yet another case of U.S. barefaced technological hegemony, as it has repeatedly resorted to the use of state power to suppress Huawei and other Chinese tech firms, citing so-called national security concerns.
Despite failing to provide a shred of evidence to substantiate its concerns, the United States continues to impose such sanctions, demonstrating its irrational and insolent behavior and imperialistic mindset.
It is not the first time the United States has suppressed a foreign company in this manner. The French company Alstom and the Japanese semiconductor industry fell prey to suppression by the United States through various means. To retain its technological edge over others, the United States turns to blatant hegemonic measures to restrict major industrial competitors, in violation of market economy and international trade rules.
The world needs fair play rather than foul play, rules-based and win-win cooperation rather than unscrupulous oppression, and justice and equality rather than bullying and hegemony.
Even some U.S. observers acknowledge the reprehensible nature of their country's policies. In a piece published online in the Economist on Jan. 12, William Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official, was quoted as saying: ""We have moved from a 'run faster' to a 'run faster and trip the other guy' policy.""
The U.S. government's technological hegemony will inevitably cause damage to the global innovation ecosystem and dampen the innovation and growth of tech companies around the world. It risks depriving people of their right to enjoy the benefits of technological progress worldwide.
In an era of globalization, the development of a country's sci-tech innovation depends on the global division of labor. Tech bullying by the United States flouts the rules and order of the international market. Such acts will only create uncertainty for businesses in their decision-making.
America's technological hegemony will also damage the interests of its allies. In seeking to maintain its own hegemony, the United States has demanded that companies from other countries cooperate with its sanctions. The companies of these allies would face a significant loss in revenue from China, the largest semiconductor market in the world, if their governments blindly mimic the self-serving policy of the United States.
Moreover, attempts to trip competitors up to maintain one's status may not bring the intended results but are more likely to backfire.
For many American companies, Huawei is an important customer and China is an important market. These enterprises have been applying to the U.S. government for supply licenses for exports to China, signaling a desire to conduct business with Chinese companies.
Many American companies have advanced their own innovation because they have Huawei as their partner. The profits they made from selling products to Huawei will also help strengthen their R&D capacity and boost their sci-tech progress.
Thus, the sanctions of the U.S. government are detrimental to the interests of American enterprises.
China will move faster toward self-reliance in science and technology so as to relieve the stranglehold some countries have tightened on China's development of core technologies. The attempts of the United States to hobble China's technological development will only accelerate the country's drive in the field.
Anyone who attempts to obstruct the path of others will have their own path blocked. The U.S. technological hegemony will create division and disorder in international trade -- a serious impediment to the COVID-impacted world economy.
Enterprises and governments around the world should act prudently and not succumb to the pressure and coercion of the United States. They should stand up to oppose its unreasonable trade actions, and safeguard international equity and justice, as well as their own interests.

The U.S. Willful Practice of Long-arm Jurisdiction and its Perils,"BEIJING, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Willful Practice of Long-arm Jurisdiction and its Perils
February 2023
Contents
Introduction
I. An Overview of U.S. Long-arm Jurisdiction
II. Exercise and Expansion of U.S. Long-arm Jurisdiction
III. The Perils of U.S. Long-arm Jurisdiction
Conclusion
Introduction
The United States has a longstanding practice of exerting frequent long-arm jurisdiction over other countries, including both its allies and countries with which it has hostile or strained relations. In recent years, the practice has kept expanding in scope, with U.S. ""arms"" stretching longer and longer. Examining cases of U.S. abuse of long-arm jurisdiction, this report lays bare the severe harm it has done to the international political and economic order and the international rule of law.
I. An Overview of U.S. Long-arm Jurisdiction
âAccording to U.S. domestic law, long-arm jurisdiction refers to jurisdiction over persons or entities domiciled or resident outside the territory of the sanctioning state. First established by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of International Shoe Co. v. State of Washington (1945), long-arm jurisdiction allows state courts to exercise in personam jurisdiction in civil and commercial cases where jurisdiction cannot be exercised because the defendant is not domiciled in the state, on the basis that the defendant has some ""minimum contacts"" with the state.
âAccording to international law, the exercise of a country's jurisdiction over an extraterritorial person or entity generally requires that the person or entity or its conduct has a real and sufficient connection to that country. Yet the U.S. exercises long-arm jurisdiction on the basis of the ""minimum contacts"" rule, constantly lowering the threshold for application. Even the flimsiest connection with the United States, such as having a branch in the United States, using U.S. dollar for clearing or other financial services, or using the U.S. mail system, constitutes ""minimum contacts.""
âTo exercise long-arm jurisdiction, the United States has further developed the ""effects doctrine,"" meaning that jurisdiction may be exercised whenever an act occurring abroad produces ""effects"" in the United States, regardless of whether the actor has U.S. citizenship or residency, and regardless of whether the act complies with the law of the place where it occurred. The United States has also been expanding the scope of its long-arm jurisdiction to exert disproportionate and unwarranted jurisdiction over extraterritorial persons or entities, enforcing U.S. domestic laws on extraterritorial non-US persons or entities, and wantonly penalizing or threatening foreign companies by exploiting their reliance on dollar-denominated businesses, the U.S. market or U.S. technologies.
âIn essence, long-arm jurisdiction is an arbitrary judicial practice, wielded by the U.S. government on the strength of its national power and financial hegemony, to enforce extraterritorial jurisdiction over entities and individuals of other countries on the ground of its domestic law.
II. Exercise and Expansion of U.S. Long-arm Jurisdiction
âIn the many years of exercising such jurisdiction, the United States has gradually developed a massive, mutually reinforcing and interlocking legal system for long-arm jurisdiction, and continued to lower the threshold and expand its discretionary power, thus shaping long-arm jurisdiction into a tool for the United States to advance hegemonic diplomacy and pursue economic interests. Such practice disregards other countries' sovereignty, blatantly meddles in others' internal affairs, seriously damages the legitimate interests of other countries, and disrupts the normal order of international exchanges. The expansion of U.S. long-arm jurisdiction is all-dimensional. Citing the ""minimum contacts"" rule and the ""effects doctrine,"" the United States has developed massive and complex legal and enforcement systems to support its long-arm jurisdiction which is expanding in scope and fields of application.
â Long-arm jurisdiction has also become a means by which the United States abuses unilateral sanctions, especially secondary sanctions. To ensure the extraterritorial effects of U.S. sanction laws, the United States would usually exercise judicial authority to hold extraterritorial entities and individuals accountable for failing to comply with U.S. sanction laws. In addition to long-arm jurisdiction, administrative, economic, financial and other means would also be employed to implement its secondary sanctions.
âCompulsory extraterritorial evidence collection is another important means of long-arm jurisdiction. In the judicial process involving other countries, the United States frequently takes unilateral compulsory measures to collect evidence outside its own territory, circumventing normal channels of judicial and law enforcement cooperation between countries. It would directly ask banks and Internet firms that have branches or are listed in the United States to provide evidence such as account information and data located outside the United States. When other countries try to raise dÃ©marche, the United States would always respond by citing excuses such as ""judicial independence"" or ""low efficiency in normal judicial assistance or law enforcement cooperation."" These typical examples of long-arm jurisdiction have severely damaged other countries' judicial sovereignty, and the legitimate rights and interests of those subjects of evidence collection.
âThe United States has put in place a whole-of-government system to practice long-arm jurisdiction, which features a division of labor among departments and inter-agency collaboration. The President and Congress are the main decision makers when it comes to sanctions. The President decides on most of the economic sanctions, and Congress participates through legislative activities under specific circumstances. At the heart of sanctions enforcement is the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), an agency under Treasury responsible for freezing assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction, formulating and adjusting lists of sanctioned individuals and entities, and reviewing and issuing licenses. The Department of State's Office of Economic Sanctions Policy and Implementation (SPI) is responsible for developing and implementing foreign policy-related sanctions. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), an agency of the Department of Commerce, administers separate lists from the OFAC. On top of these, the U.S. government bolsters its sanctions enforcement through control of SWIFT and CHIPS, two major cross-border payment and clearing systems, by pressing them, when it deems necessary, to cut off contact with the financial institutions of the subject country to achieve the purpose of economic sanctions.
âThe United States has stepped up legislation for long-arm jurisdiction. A wide range of laws in the United States advance long-arm jurisdiction, including Trading with the Enemy Act, International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and Helms-Burton Act. Others such as the USA PATRIOT Act and National Defense Authorization Act contain long-arm jurisdiction clauses. A number of presidential executive orders also involve long-arm jurisdiction. More and more U.S. federal legislation contains long-arm jurisdiction clauses to prevent Americans from circumventing U.S. laws by establishing subsidiaries in foreign countries, or foreigners enjoying less restrictions than Americans, or relevant international rules-making hurting U.S. interests. These legislative moves allow the United States to enforce long-arm jurisdiction in its diplomacy by citing domestic laws.
â There is a growing tendency of the U.S. applying long-arm jurisdiction to criminal cases, which is an extreme abuse of the practice. In recent years, a number of U.S. federal laws include extraterritorial clauses, which have been exploited by the Department of Justice to launch criminal investigations and prosecutions. In these proceedings, federal courts begin to apply the concept of long-arm jurisdiction when examining the basis of their jurisdiction by broadly interpreting the connection between the case and the United States, expanding the scope of personal and territorial jurisdiction, and lowering the threshold for the application of protective jurisdiction and general jurisdiction.
III. The Perils of U.S. Long-arm Jurisdiction
âThe United States is the only sanctions superpower in the world. According to the Treasury 2021 Sanctions Review, by fiscal year 2021,the number of active U.S. sanctions designations had increased to more than 9,400.
âSanctions strain relations between countries and undermine the international order. Healthy state-to-state relations are the bedrock for peace and stability in the international order. In the 1990s, the United States introduced the Helms-Burton Act to impose economic sanctions through long-arm jurisdiction on individuals and entities worldwide conducting transactions with Cuba. It sparked strong opposition from the European Union, who in 1996 passed the Blocking Statute to neutralize through legislation the effects of U.S. long-arm jurisdiction within the EU, and enable individuals and entities in the EU to sue individuals and entities in the United States. Apart from this, the EU put forward a series of proposals and initiatives at the UN General Assembly, the Security Council, the World Trade Organization and other international bodies, calling on the international community to pay attention to the harmful effects of U.S. long-arm jurisdiction, and even resorted to the WTO dispute settlement procedures. So far, the ""long arm"" of U.S. jurisdiction has reached China, Russia, Iran, Syria, the DPRK, Cuba, France, the UK, Germany, Japan, among others. In an article published in Foreign Affairs, Professor Daniel Drezner of Tufts University criticized successive U.S. administrations for abusing economic coercion and economic violence and using sanctions as the preferred solution to diplomatic problems, which have been ineffective and causing humanitarian disasters.
âSince 1979, the United States has imposed various types of unilateral sanctions on Iran and other countries. In 1996, it rolled out the D'Amato Act which forbids foreign companies from investing in the energy sector of Iran and Libya, resulting in long-term damaging ramifications. Afterward, the United States keeps ramping up sanctions against Iran. Under the Trump administration, it harbored a policy of ""maximum pressure"" and wanted to use sanctions to effect a regime change in Iran. According to then Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, sanctions under the Trump administration caused at least US$200 billion worth of economic damage to Iran; he condemned such sanctions as inhumane, a crime and an act of terrorism.
âBetween 1980 and 1992, the United States imposed unilateral sanctions on Libya, and from 1992 to 2003, it rallied or coerced allies into expanding sanctions against Libya. The World Bank noted that Libya suffered up to US$18 billion economic losses as a result of the sanctions, while an official Libyan estimate put the figure at 33 billion.
âCrude U.S. sanctions on Iraq after the Gulf War brought about serious consequences. From August 1990 to May 2003, they caused a total loss of US$150 billion in Iraq's oil revenue. As a result, the country's per capita income falls below its 1990 level of US$7,050 even to this day. The sanctions have also caused a serious humanitarian disaster, with infant mortality rate doubling and the under-five mortality increasing six-fold. Meanwhile, Iraq's education, health and social security systems were destroyed; its literacy rate fell from 89 percent in 1987 to 57 percent in 1997.
âUndermining the purposes and functions of various international governance mechanisms. The United States has frequently imposed unilateral sanctions outside the UN framework. In 2021 alone, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Department of Commerce and other agencies imposed various sanctions on as many as over 2,000 entities. As a result, the sanctioning function of the Security Council is undercut, seriously affecting its normal function of maintaining international peace and security. When the International Criminal Court (ICC) attempted to investigate suspected war crimes by U.S. forces in Afghanistan, the United States, with itself not being a member of the Court, responded by launching sanctions against ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and senior official Phakiso Mochochoko, sparking unanimous outcry from the international community. Despite the ruling of the Dispute Settlement Body of WTO that its Section 301 procedures are a violation of international law, the United States continues to launch various unilateral Section 301 investigations on imports from China and other countries, and keeps all existing Section 301 tariffs unchanged. Such actions have directly sabotaged the tariff concessions achieved by many rounds of difficult negotiations of the multilateral trading system, blatantly trampled on the purposes and spirit of the multilateral trading system, and eroded the cornerstone of the system's operation.
âUndermining the interests of companies of other countries. To maintain its economic and technological supremacy, the United States abuses its public power to interfere with normal international commercial exchanges and competition. Under the pretext of safeguarding national security and fighting against human rights violations, it has adopted a package of measures including the Entity List and economic sanctions to restrict foreign enterprises from obtaining raw materials, items and technologies vital to their survival and development, sometimes even used secondary sanctions to cut those companies' normal trade with enterprises from other countries in an effort to disrupt their supply chains root and branch.
âA case in point is the imprisonment of a senior manager from the French company Alstom. In 2013, in order to beat Alstom in their business competition, the United States applied the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to arrest and detain FrÃ©dÃ©ric Pierucci on charges of bribing foreign officials. He was further induced to sign a plea deal and provide more evidence and information against his company, leaving Alstom no choice but to accept General Electric's acquisition, vanishing ever since from the Fortune 500 list. The U.S. long-arm jurisdiction has become a tool for its public power to suppress competitors and meddle in normal international business activities, announcing the United Statesâ complete departure from its long-standing self-proclaimed champion of liberal market economy.
âIn recent years, the United States has frequently employed the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (2016) to impose unilateral sanctions on entities in various countries deemed to have engaged in ""serious human rights violations."" However, while exercising such unilateral sanctions, the United States has often violated the basic human rights of the sanctioned subjects disregarding the fact that their human rights are also entitled to protection.
âWhen COVID-19 was raging in the world, the U.S. government did not relent in imposing unilateral sanctions on Iran, Syria and other countries, making it difficult for these countries to obtain the much-needed medical supplies to fight the virus. As a result of the sanctions, Iran has been cut off access to essential medicines and medical equipment, putting the health of millions of Iranians in jeopardy. To raise funds to fight the pandemic, the Iranian government applied to the IMF for a US$5 billion dollar exclusive loan, but the effort was blocked by the United States. Even worse, the United States prevented Iran from importing COVID vaccines by freezing its overseas funds and threatening vaccine suppliers. As the Brookings Institution estimated, during the height of the pandemic in Iran, U.S. sanctions further exacerbated the spread of the virus and could have caused up to 13,000 of deaths.
Conclusion
The U.S. long-arm jurisdiction is not something new. In spite of adaptations over time in its contents and measures, the nature of the U.S. long-arm jurisdiction has not changed: it has been, since the very beginning, a hegemonic tool to maintain U.S. hegemony, suppress foreign competitors, interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and even subvert the governments of other countries. Over the last few years, the United States has abused long-arm jurisdiction by continuing to lower the threshold and intensifying measures to an unprecedented degree against wider range of targets. It not only undermines the principle of sovereign equality, violates international law, and erodes the multilateral order with the UN at its core, but also creates and intensifies tensions and conflicts among major countries, and poses a threat to the international security system established after World War II. It also interferes with and distorts normal international commercial exchanges and trade order, disrupts the supply chain of global trade, damages the interests of enterprises and raises their operating costs. The United States should renounce its illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction measures, and truly take up its international responsibilities as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.

"Tyre Nichols' death once again exposes U.S. scars of police brutality, racial prejudice","NEW YORK, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- The past week has witnessed the nightly tides of street protests across the United States in the aftermath of the death of Tyre Nichols, which once again exposed the country's long-standing scars of police brutality and racial prejudice.
In a statement issued on Jan. 27. U.S. President Joe Biden said he ""was outraged and deeply pained"" by the incident, calling it ""yet another painful reminder of the profound fear and trauma, the pain, and the exhaustion that Black and Brown Americans experience every single day.""
Over again, federal officials and politicians vowed to ""do everything in our power"" to end such tragedy. However, similar incidents always take place from time to time in the country that is self-claimed as the ""beacon of democracy.""
APPALLING VIOLENCE
Mostly peaceful protests over police brutality were carried out around the country after the public release of body camera footage brought the police killing of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee, into clearer picture.
Nichols, a 29-year-old Black motorist, was pulled over on Jan. 7 for what police said was reckless driving. After attempting to flee on foot, Nichols was aggressively beaten by police, newly released police video showed. Three days later, he died in the hospital.
Attorneys representing the family of Nichols have said that an independent autopsy they commissioned found Nichols suffering ""extensive bleeding caused by a severe beating."" The full findings of the report were not made public.
Four of the five former Memphis Police officers indicted for their role in the death of Nichols were suspended or received a written reprimand during their tenure, with only one charged officer avoiding internal disciplining during his tenure.
Nichols, the father of a four-year-old son, was known to his family as an avid skateboarder and nature photographer from Sacramento, California, according to The Associated Press.
He arrived in Memphis just before the pandemic and later started a job with FedEx, a major employer there. The New York Times reported that Nichols had been with the company for about nine months before his death.
WINDOWS BROKEN
""Tyre Nichols: U.S. police violence stems from a long history of fighting 'internal enemies,'"" read a headline from U.S. news portal The Conversation.
""Next to other western democracies, America has historically had a far bigger proportion of racial and ethnic minorities,"" and few of those minorities have fit easily within the constitutionally recognized community of ""the people,"" said the report.
""White authorities were very clear as to the rationale"" that ""Black people were neither citizens (like white men) nor members of households (like white women and children),"" said the report. ""Rather, they were an 'internal enemy,' a hostile and alien element within the lawful community.""
Blacks were regarded as existential threats to the lawful population. These sentiments fuelled violence by the U.S. National Guard, by hired thugs known as Pinkertons and by lynch mobs, noted the news portal.
The most recent echo of the pattern is the so-called ""broken windows"" philosophy of policing that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s. The basic idea here is that fear of violent crime is itself cause for police intervention, it added.
LEGISLATURE FAILURES
Mourning the death of Nichols, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday expressed hope that Nichols' death might ""shine a light on the path toward peace and justice"" as she called on Congress to pass police reform legislation.
Initially introduced in 2020 and again in 2021, the legislation is aimed at setting up a national registry of police misconduct to stop officers from evading consequences for their actions by moving to another jurisdiction.
The bill twice cleared the House of Representatives under Democratic control, in 2020 and 2021, mainly along party lines. But it never went anywhere in the Senate, even after Democrats won control in 2021, ""in part, because of disagreements about qualified immunity, which protects police officers from being sued in civil court,"" CNN once reported.
""And the road for police reform has only become more challenging in the new Congress now that House Republicans, who have placed their priorities elsewhere, are in the majority,"" it added.

Filipinos speak out against U.S. military expansion plans,"MANILA, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- Filipinos have spoken out against American military expansion plans in their country following a top U.S. defense official's visit to the Southeast Asian country this week.
""That is not part of our national interest. Our national interest is to become an economically prosperous country. And we can only do that if we can have peace in the country and peace in the region,"" said Anna Malindog-Uy, vice president of the Manila-based think tank Asian Century Philippines Strategic Studies Institute.
She warned that the United States is seeking to widen its military presence in the Philippines and expand access to the country's military facilities.
On Thursday, protesters gathered outside the military headquarters in the Philippine capital, where U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with his Philippine counterpart, Carlito Galvez, calling for an end to the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, a military agreement between Washington and Manila allowing U.S. access to Philippine military bases.
""They would want to use my country to preserve their hegemony in Asia,"" the scholar on international relations told Xinhua, urging her government to ""exercise extreme caution and prudence.""
""Our country and our survival as a nation will be threatened to a greater extent. It's not for the Philippines,"" Malindog-Uy said. ""It's more for American military activities.""

Weekly storage of natural gas in U.S. down,"HOUSTON, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- Working gas storage in the contiguous United States was 2,583 billion cubic feet in the week ending Jan. 27, a net decrease of 151 billion cubic feet from the previous week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said Thursday.
The total working gas storage increased by 9.4 percent from this time last year, and was up 6.7 percent from the five-year average, according to the EIA's Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report.
The storage of working gas in the United States usually turns to decrease in November and continues to drop in April when the heating season ends in the country, according to previous data.
Working gas is defined as the amount of natural gas stored underground that can be withdrawn for use. Its storage capacity can be measured in two ways: design capacity and demonstrated maximum working gas capacity.
The contiguous United States consists of the country's 48 adjoining states, plus the District of Columbia, and excludes the non-contiguous states of Alaska and Hawaii, and all off-shore insular areas.

NEW YORK, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- Black children living in poverty face increased instances of stress and trauma that can alter their brain development, CNN reported on Saturday, citing a new study.
In the study published last week by the American Journal of Psychiatry, researchers found that increased stressors like economic hardship and systemic racism play a significant role for Black children and can lead to the development of mental health issues as they age.
The stressors contribute to Black children having less gray matter in their brains, a byproduct of absorbing ""toxic stress.""
The study defines the stressors as ""prolonged exposure to adverse experiences"" that lead to excessive stress hormones and ""disrupt the immune and metabolic regulatory systems.""
Researchers at Harvard University examined MRI scans of 7,350 White and 1,786 Black children ages 9 and 10. The data in the study was collected by the National Institutes of Health in 2019, according to the CNN report.

To catch up with other high-income countries, the administration and Congress would have to expand access to health care, act aggressively to control costs, and invest in health equity and social services we know can lead to a healthier population.
NEW YORK, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States spends more on health care than any other high-income country but still has the lowest life expectancy at birth and the highest rate of people with multiple chronic diseases, CNN reported.
A report from The Commonwealth Fund, an independent research group, as quoted by CNN last week, said that compared with peer nations, the United States has the highest rates of deaths from avoidable or treatable causes and the highest maternal and infant death rates.
""Americans are living shorter, less healthy lives because our health system is not working as well as it could be,"" the report's lead author, Munira Gunja, senior researcher for The Commonwealth Fund's International Program in Health Policy and Practice Innovation, said in a news release.

"Iran says ""diplomatic dynamism"" exists in talks to revive nuclear deal","TEHRAN, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Monday that ""diplomatic dynamism"" exists through different channels in the talks to revive a 2015 nuclear deal and remove anti-Iran sanctions.
Exchange of messages between different sides to the deal is continuing at different levels, Iran's official news agency IRNA quoted Nasser Kanaani as saying during a weekly press conference.
Iran has always welcomed with goodwill efforts and measures aimed at resolving the issue and achieving a nuclear agreement, he noted.
According to Kanaani, Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) still carry out regular cooperation, in addition to constant and direct negotiations between Iranian envoys and the IAEA in Vienna and talks between experts from both sides.
Negotiations will continue between the two sides within technical frameworks, Kanaani said.
Iran signed the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), with world powers in July 2015, agreeing to put some curbs on its nuclear program in return for the removal of the sanctions on the country. The United States, however, pulled out of the deal in May 2018 and reimposed its unilateral sanctions on Iran, prompting the latter to reduce some of its nuclear commitments under the deal.
The talks on the JCPOA's revival began in April 2021 in Vienna. No breakthrough has been achieved after the latest round of talks in August 2022.

STOCKHOLM, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- Inflation continues to hover at lofty levels in Sweden with food prices registering the largest monthly increases in a year, according to a report released here on Monday.
In a survey covering around 44,000 items, price comparison site Matpriskollen found that food prices increased by 1.3 percent in January, which is one of the largest monthly increases since inflation took off sharply in January 2022, Swedish Television (SVT) reported.
The prices of snacks and sweets increased by 3.1 percent month-on-month in January and by 14.8 percent year-on-year, followed by fish and seafood 2.4 percent (20.2 percent year-on-year), desserts 2.3 percent (17.2 percent), vegetables 1.9 percent (13.5 percent) and bread and cookies 1.9 percent (16.3 percent), SVT reported.
Although the price hikes for cheese and dairy products were not as steep in January as for some other categories, cheese became 25.4 percent more expensive year-on-year, while the price of dairy products increased by 23.6 percent.
Matpriskollen's survey also found that some items for which inflation was relatively modest in 2022 suddenly became considerably more expensive in January.
""For some items, the price hike was brutal in January,"" Ulf Mazur, founder and managing director of Matpriskollen, told SVT.
""This concerns, for example, sugar and beer. The remarkable thing is that it was not a long and slow increase but a shock increase (in January) for certain items,"" Mazur told SVT.
As an example, SVT listed a brand of sugar in a particular size of packaging that was 44 percent more expensive in January.
There are also examples where tomato juice and gluten-free pasta became 40 percent and 33 percent more expensive, respectively, SVT reported.
According to the latest data released by Statistics Sweden in January, 12-month inflation measured as Consumer Price Index (CPI) stood at 12.3 percent in December, which was the highest rate of inflation since February 1991.

""This is one of the largest earthquakes in recent times. TÃ¼rkiye and Syria need all the help they can get. The current search and rescue efforts will last a few days but soon the main priority will be medical assistance for the injured, the restoration of water, power and other services, and shelter for those who have lost their homes,"" said former UN relief chief Mark Lowcock.
UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of devastating earthquakes that struck southern TÃ¼rkiye and northern Syria early Monday, UN aid agencies have scrambled to help many thousands of reported victims, including those still believed to be buried under the rubble.
""My heart goes out to the people of TÃ¼rkiye and Syria in this hour of tragedy,"" said the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in a statement. ""The United Nations is fully committed to supporting the response. Our teams are on the ground assessing the needs and providing assistance.""
The initial 7.8 magnitude quake struck close to Gaziantep, a major city and capital of the Gaziantep Province, in the westernmost part of TÃ¼rkiye's Southeastern Anatolia Region, followed by another 7.5 magnitude tremor several hours later.
After the second earthquake, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) released a situation overview saying that ""close to 2,000 deaths have been reported"" in the two countries impacted, with at least 78 aftershocks.
A Level 4 alarm has been issued by the Turkish government, requesting international assistance.
In northwest Syria, 4.1 million people rely on humanitarian assistance, mostly women and children.
A cholera outbreak is ongoing in Syrian communities, coupled with harsh winter weather. In the last quarter of 2022, there is a funding gap of 48 percent, with 371 million U.S. dollars pledged out of a required total of just over 800 million.

""As part of the United Nations family, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) stands ready to support affected people in the coming days, weeks and months as they recover from this tragedy,"" UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said in a statement.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has authorized emergency medical teams to provide care to the injured and most vulnerable populations, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a tweet.
The OCHA noted that the epicenter of the initial 7.8 magnitude earthquake is close to Gaziantep in southern TÃ¼rkiye, an important UN aid hub for northern Syria. Many cities in the region were affected.
""This is one of the largest earthquakes in recent times. TÃ¼rkiye and Syria need all the help they can get. The current search and rescue efforts will last a few days but soon the main priority will be medical assistance for the injured, the restoration of water, power and other services, and shelter for those who have lost their homes,"" said former UN relief chief Mark Lowcock in a live commentary obtained by Xinhua through email.
Lowcock is a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, a nonprofit think tank based in Washington, D.C., and London, which focuses on international development.
""Deeply saddened by the loss of life caused by this morning's #earthquake,"" the UN refugee agency in Syria tweeted, adding that it was ""actively coordinating a response with #UN Agencies and other humanitarian actors to deliver assistance and support to those in need in Syria.""

In northern Syria's Aleppo and Idlib, thousands of buildings, including two hospitals, collapsed during the earthquake, which was felt as far away as Lebanon.
Millions of Syrians have been displaced by the long-running war in northern Syria, which poses huge humanitarian needs.
Rescue teams have been hindered by snow and rain, and many of their families are believed to be buried under collapsed buildings.
In response to an official request for international assistance from Ankara, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) confirmed it was willing to assist.
""Our hearts and thoughts are with the children and families in TÃ¼rkiye and Syria affected by the devastating earthquakes. Our deepest condolences to those who lost loved ones,"" said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.

"Abused, erased, but forgotten no more","
Demonstrators condemn racism against Asians at a rally in Washington, DC, on June 25. [PHOTO by LIU JIE/XINHUA]
Editor's note: Growing racism against Asian Americans is far from a new phenomenon, as we detail with coverage of efforts to preserve local history in San Francisco. And online abuse serves as a reminder of the urgency to tackle the deep roots of discrimination in the US.
Efforts to shed light on a bitter slice of history for Asian Americans resonate amid rising racism
Overlooking San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge and surrounding an art museum, the scenic Lincoln Park in a now wealthy and privileged neighborhood was once a burial ground for thousands of Chinese immigrants who helped build the city more than 100 years ago.
To this day, the remains of hundreds of bodies still rest beneath the green turf of the Lincoln Park Golf Course, with many residents and golfers unaware of their presence.
A weather-beaten funerary monument, near the first hole of the golf course, is the last standing structure that hints at the past of the park as a graveyard.
The Chinese inscription on the structure, covered with patches of lichens and faded paint, indicates ""a temporary resting place for sojourners from Guangzhou"".
The early Chinese immigrants originally wanted to be buried in their hometowns because it's the Chinese tradition that no matter how far they travel, their bodies should return to their homes.
However, their wishes were never fulfilled as the burial ground, known as City Cemetery, was transformed into a public park and golf course in the early 20th century.
Thanks to some local historians and Chinese communities, the cemetery has recently been designated as the city's first archaeological landmark.
The monument also has been marked as ""Kong Chow Sojourners Tombs"" (Kong Chow means Guangzhou) in Google Maps. Two users have left five-star reviews for the location and posted photos.
Yellow chrysanthemums, symbolizing grief in Chinese culture, and burning incense were seen in front of the ""Kong Chow"" shrine, a tradition to pay tribute to the deceased.
""I'm a frequent visitor to the Legion of Honor Museum, but I had never known here is the resting place for my ancestors until recently,"" said Yuyan Li, a first-generation immigrant from Guangdong province who lives not far from the park.

'Feeling sad'
""I feel so sad that they couldn't return to their roots and are permanently rested here. And I feel even sadder when I learned they were discriminated against when they were alive and erased from the history after they died,"" the graphic designer told China Daily.
City Cemetery was a large burial ground for marginalized groups who couldn't pay for burials. It's estimated that more than 10,000 Chinese residents were buried in the cemetery during its operation from 1870 until 1898. The Chinese took up half of all burials, making it the largest and most significant burial ground for San Francisco's Chinese communities.
After the site was reclassified as a municipal park in 1909, users of the cemetery were given six months to disinter the remains of their buried dead.
It is not clear how many were removed because no records have survived. But historians estimate that at least 10,000 are still buried at Lincoln Park, many of them Chinese.
The forgotten history of City Cemetery reflects the mistreatment of Chinese immigrants who helped build the city but were often excluded from the narratives of the city's history.
Chinese laborers first arrived in San Francisco in the 1850s during the Gold Rush era, and immediately faced racism and discrimination in every aspect of their lives, including employment, housing, education and culture.
Many of the discriminatory policies at that time sought to undermine the progress of Chinese immigrants by banning them from schools and the levers of power. For example, an 1860 policy prohibited Chinese students from attending public schools with white students, and an 1870 law barred anyone of Chinese descent from employment in any government work.
The city also passed more than a dozen ordinances from 1873 to 1883 cracking down on Chinese laundries, leading to the infamous riots of 1877, which left four people dead and 20 laundry houses destroyed.
Last year, San Francisco formally apologized to Chinese immigrants and their descendants for past atrocities amid a national trend of recognizing the history and contributions of Asian Americans.
The Chinese community and San Francisco Heritage, a nonprofit organization, initiated efforts to preserve the history of City Cemetery about two years ago during rising anti-Asian hate and violence across the country.
San Francisco Supervisor Connie Chan, a first-generation Chinese immigrant, introduced a resolution to designate the site as a historic landmark in April 2021. Mayor London Breed signed it into law in October 2022 after it was unanimously passed by the board of supervisors.
Chan said she hoped the landmark designation would help people remember ""the blood and tears our Chinese immigrants shed as part of the power that has built San Francisco into the great city it is today"".

Landmark designation
Woody LaBounty, interim president and CEO of San Francisco Heritage, said this site is ""a sacred space that deserves to be commemorated"" and a landmark designation would be an important first step.
With the historic landmark status, the activists said the site could be better preserved with more attention and potential funding. For marginalized groups, landmarking a forgotten place such as the ""Kong Chow"" monument and City Cemetery is a restorative act of social justice, they said.
Facing opposition from some golfers who were concerned that the landmarking would interfere with the maintenance of their playing grounds, the activists received support from Allison Vanderslice, principal environmental planner for the city.
The site captures the cultural diversity of early San Francisco and is ""significant for its ability to add to our understanding of history and also its cultural associations and its funerary structures"", she said.
Since 2021, the Chinese community has held ceremonies for Chongyang Festival (Double Ninth Festival), and Qingming Festival (Tomb Sweeping Day), when the Chinese pay their respects to the elderly and the deceased, respectively, at the Kong Chow monument. They were the first such ceremonies in decades.
Chan hopes that Chinese Americans and community organizations will return to the monument each year to celebrate such traditional festivals.
Li, the graphic designer, said she planned to attend the next ceremony, which usually includes prayers, the burning of incense and the offering of food. ""It would be a personal moment for me to honor my ancestors' struggle and sacrifice in this land,"" she said.

An explosion occurred on a gas pipeline in TÃ¼rkiye's southern province of Hatay and natural gas flow to southern Gaziantep, Hatay and Kahramanmaras provinces was suspended as a precaution.
At the port of Iskenderun district in southern Hatay province, a fire broke out following the earthquake and emergency services intervened in the blaze.

In southern Gaziantep, walls and watch towers of an ancient castle, constructed as an observation point by the Hittite Empire, have been leveled, while other parts are largely destroyed by the earthquake.
TÃ¼rkiye declared national mourning for a week, with the flags to be flown half-mast. The Turkish education ministry has announced that schools across the country will be closed for seven days until Feb. 13.
""Due to the earthquakes that took place in our country on Feb. 6, a national mourning period was declared for seven days,"" said President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. ""Turkish flag will be hoisted at half-mast until sunset on Sunday all around TÃ¼rkiye, at all foreign representations.""
The country has often faced earthquakes due to its location at the crossroads of three different tectonic plates in Anatolia.
Monday's earthquake is believed to be the strongest in TÃ¼rkiye since the magnitude 7.9 eastern Erzincan province quake of 1939, which killed 33,000 people.
In 1999, a 7.4-magnitude quake hit northwestern Izmit province, around 90 km east of Istanbul, killing at least 17,500 people, including 1,000 living in Istanbul.
The Turkish authorities have introduced tighter building regulations, revised urban planning, and improved key public infrastructure amid a public awareness campaign following the 1999 quake.

Deadly weekend shootings reflect again persistent gun violence in U.S.,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- Multiple deaths were reported in several fatal shootings across the United States over the weekend, revealing again the insurmountable problem of gun violence in the country.
A 19-year-old woman was killed and four others injured in a shooting at a concert in Newport, Arkansas on Saturday night, local media reported, citing police sources.
One of the wounded was taken to hospital for further treatment and two people have been arrested, with more arrests expected, said the report, adding that an investigation is underway.
Another 41-year-old victim was lethally shot while sitting in his vehicle in the Lawndale neighborhood of Chicago Saturday morning, local police said.
The man, who succumbed to his injuries after he was sent to a local hospital, was attacked by a gunman in a silver sedan who fled the scene on Lexington Street, according to the police.
Another shooting took place at the DeSoto County Fair in a rural part of Florida on Saturday, killing a teenage boy, local authorities said.
The shooting was identified as an isolated incident and the police have failed to catch the gunman by midday Sunday, they added.
The murderous weekend again raised the escalating issue of gun violence in the United States to public concern, sparking an outcry for stricter gun controls.
The United States has reported over 3,500 deaths from gun violence since the start of this year with more than 50 mass shootings recorded, according to Gun Violence Archive, a website that tracks gun violence in the country.
""We have the highest rates of gun deaths in the world. We have more guns than people ... We have more than one gun for every man, woman and child in America. That is insanity,"" Paul Cole Padilla, an educational administrator, told Xinhua.
""The trend (of gun violence) is going to get worse,"" said Stephen Ndegwa, a lecturer on international relations at the Nairobi-based United States International University-Africa.
The expert warned that 2023 could be ""the worst year"" of gun violence in the history of the United States if the trend continues.
Cihat Yayci, a retired Turkish admiral, said the high rate of individual armament ownership, resulting from the powerful gun lobbies in the United States, is one of the main reasons for the increasing shootings in the country.
Both Republicans and Democrats are funded by gun rights advocacy groups, which have been conducting intense propaganda among ordinary people, said Yayci.
Late last month, U.S. President Joe Biden released a statement, calling for tightened restrictions on gun purchase.
According to Biden, a federal Assault Weapons Ban and legislation were reintroduced to raise the minimum purchase age for assault weapons to 21 after the mass shootings.
""I once again urge both chambers of Congress to act quickly and deliver this Assault Weapons Ban to my desk, and take action to keep American communities, schools, workplaces, and homes safe,"" he noted.

UN envoy to Libya stresses need for fair distribution of wealth,"TRIPOLI, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- The Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Libya Abdoulaye Bathily on Sunday stressed the importance of the fair distribution of the country's wealth to the Libyans.
Bathily made the remarks during a meeting with Libyan Prime Minister Abdul-Hamed Dbeibah in the capital Tripoli, where they discussed ways to ""end the political stalemate and prepare the country for inclusive national elections in 2023,"" according to the tweets posted by Bathily.
The UN envoy highlighted that it is the responsibility of all actors to establish conditions conducive to holding elections, starting with adopting a solid constitutional framework.

""During the meeting, I stressed the need to adopt the best standards of transparency and good governance to ensure a fair distribution of Libyan wealth where all Libyans equally benefit from it,"" Bathily said.
Libya failed to hold general elections in December 2021 as previously scheduled due to disagreements over election laws among the Libyan parties.

NICOSIA, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- Former Cypriot foreign minister Nicos Christodoulides took the lead in Cyprus' presidential election on Sunday, and will face off with Andreas Mavroyiannis, who came second, in a runoff on Feb. 12.
Christodoulides, who ran as an independent, garnered 32.04 percent of the vote, and Mavroyiannis, who also ran as an independent and supported by the left wing AKEL party, garnered 29.61 percent of the vote, Chief Returning Officer Costas Constantinou announced after the counting of all votes on Sunday.
Fourteen candidates participated in the election, but none of them won an absolute majority.
Averof Neophytou, leader of the ruling DISY party, ended third with 26.11 percent of the vote and was thus left out of the presidential race, ending the party's ten-year-long hold on power in the eastern Mediterranean island.
Neophytou's performance in the election was considered by political analysts as a blow not only to himself but also to his right-wing party.
Both Christodoulides and Mavroyiannis had been close associates of the outgoing president Nicos Anastasiades who will step down at the end of February.
Christodoulides served for four years as spokesman for Anastasiades and then as his foreign minister for another four years.
Mavroyiannis, a diplomat at the foreign ministry, had been Anastasiades' negotiator in peace talks with Turkish Cypriots for a settlement to the Cyprus problem.
Political analysts said that the two presidential hopefuls would start wooing DISY voters for their support ahead of the runoff vote.
A DISY official said the party would meet on Monday to decide its official stance in relation to the runoff.
The Chief Returning Officer said that out of 561,273 registered voters 404,403 people, or 72.05 percent, cast ballot papers.

UN condemns deadly clashes in South Sudan after killing of 27,"JUBA, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) on Sunday condemned deadly violence in Kajo-Keji County in South Sudan's Central Equatoria State that left at least 27 dead and several others injured on Feb. 2.
Nicholas Haysom, the UN secretary-general's special representative in South Sudan, called on the authorities to urgently launch an investigation and hold perpetrators to account.
""This violence is unacceptable and was in sharp contrast to the message of the Ecumenical Peace Pilgrimage to South Sudan, which called for peace and reconciliation,"" Haysom said in a statement issued in Juba, the capital of South Sudan.
He said at least 2,000 people, mainly women and children, have become internally displaced, including 30 unaccompanied children.
The UN expressed concern about the resurgence of killings and violence stemming from long-standing tensions between cattle-keepers and host communities in Central Equatoria State and in other parts of the country.
Over the past two weeks, the UNMISS said, escalating violence has resulted in at least 45 deaths among unarmed civilians in Kajo-Keji and Mangalla Payam, among other areas in Central Equatoria.
Haysom urged South Sudanese leaders to encourage restraint and avoid fueling any conflict, noting that the UNMISS is increasing patrols to the affected areas, and engaging the authorities as well as community leaders, to end these hostilities and seek peaceful solutions.
The UNMISS said it welcomes the government's deployment of troops to the area to ease tensions and protect internally displaced persons.

Nurses in Britain walk out over payment amid strained medical services,"

LONDON, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- Nurses and ambulance workers in Britain on Monday started another round of strikes in the thick of lengthy and intensifying disputes over payment.
Health workers won support amid a raging cost-of-living crisis, and the industrial action was feared to put more pressure on the medical system.
BIGGEST DAY
Nursing staff were set to strike again in England on Monday and Tuesday. The two-day walkouts will be at the highest intensity in the union's history, taking place at 73 National Health Service (NHS) trusts in England, compared to 44 in December and 55 in January, according to the Royal College of Nursing (RCN).
Members of other health unions were also on strike, making Monday the single biggest day of strike action in the 75-year history of the NHS, the RCN added, noting that the Welsh government made an offer to NHS staff of an additional 3 percent pay rise and the planned strike action in Wales for this week was canceled.
""Your government looks increasingly isolated in refusing to reopen discussions about the 2022-23 NHS pay award. As a result, the strike action for England remains -- with tens of thousands of nurses losing wages to ensure you hear their voice,"" said RCN General Secretary Pat Cullen. ""It must not be in vain.""
Also on Monday, ambulance workers represented by trade unions Unite, Unison and the GMB in trusts across England, Northern Ireland and Wales took strike action.
""This dispute will only be resolved when it enters into proper negotiations about the current pay dispute,"" said Unite national lead officer Onay Kasab. ""The government's constant attempts to kick the can down the road and its talk about one off payments, or slightly increased pay awards in the future, is simply not sufficient to resolve this dispute.""
In response, the British government has said the pay rises are unaffordable and that higher pay will not help fight raging inflation. Minister for Mental Health and Women's Health Strategy Maria Caulfield on Monday called on the RCN to suspend strikes in England to allow for pay negotiations.
The government has a responsibility to all taxpayers and every one percent increase is about 700 million pounds (842 million U.S. dollars) that the government has to find, Caulfield told Sky News.
PAY DISPUTES
Since the beginning of its action, the RCN has asked for a pay rise above inflation. The value of salaries for experienced nurses is 20 percent lower in real terms since 2010, due to successive below-inflation pay awards, said the union in December.
Back in November, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Steve Barclay tweeted that the government has accepted the recommendations of the NHS Pay Review Body to give nurses a pay rise of at least 1,400 pounds (1,685 dollars), and this means a newly qualified nurse will typically earn over 31,000 pounds (37,302 dollars) a year.
While the RCN was demanding a pay rise of 17.6 percent, it was ""an increase around three times the average settlement that millions of hardworking people outside the public sector are getting,"" Barclay added.
Britain has been in the grip of consistently high inflation because of both global and domestic factors. Its consumer price index rose at an annual rate of 10.5 percent in December, and the cost-of-living crisis facing households continued as food inflation remained historically high, official figures showed.
Meanwhile, wages have failed to keep up for a long time. ""The lack of growth in average real-terms earnings since the financial crisis is clear,"" noted a report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies in October. Average public sector earnings in July 2022 were 4 percent lower in real terms than in July 2007, it showed.
""The very large number of strikes, very much concentrated in the public sector or previously public sector occupations, is really the result of an unprecedentedly long period of downward pressure on pay,"" Deborah Dean, co-director of the Industrial Relations Research Unit at the Warwick Business School, has told Xinhua.
Dean said health services were under great strain. ""You can't go on, particularly after the acute pressures of the pandemic, where extraordinary demands were made on NHS staff, and in particular frontline staff nurses and doctors, and people have left through ill health, through the pressures,"" she noted.
""UNPRECEDENTED PRESSURES""
Back in July 2022, a Health and Social Care Committee report said the NHS and social care sectors ""are facing the greatest workforce crisis in their history."" An official briefing showed the total number of NHS vacancies in June 2022 was 132,139, a vacancy rate of 9.7 percent, which was an increase from the previous year, when the number of vacancies was 98,827 and the rate was 7.6 percent.
""Pay and employment have reduced. Funding has reduced. And this has meant people are both effectively being paid less and also their work is intensified because there are fewer people doing the necessary jobs,"" Dean said, noting that it in particular is one of the reasons why nurses went on strike.
Patients were suffering. Poor health and unprecedented NHS waiting lists are forcing people out of work, the RCN noted earlier this month. Data shows 6.9 million were waiting for NHS treatment in England as of November 2022, almost one million more than the previous year, it added.
""People are having to wait longer to access services when demand has never been greater,"" RCN Director for England Patricia Marquis said. ""Patients are not dying because nurses are striking. Nurses are striking because patients are dying.""
But analysis showed that the ongoing strikes also put more strains on the medical system. NHS England data showed that more than 5,000 operations and 30,000 outpatient appointments had needed to be rescheduled across strike days, according to the NHS Confederation in January.
Commenting on the Monday strikes, Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: ""This escalation takes us deeper into the situation NHS leaders have been warning against -- a war of attrition between the government and unions spanning several months at a time when NHS services are seeing unprecedented pressures.""
""We're increasingly concerned about the cumulative impact of strike days and record demand -- the longer this vicious cycle continues the longer it will take for the NHS to tackle the elective backlog,"" Taylor said.

PARIS, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 757,000 people took to the streets across France on Tuesday to demand government to drop its proposed pension reforms, the ministry of interior said on Tuesday.
However, the CGT, France's largest union, said that the turnout exceeded two million during the third day of the general mobilization against the pension reform that would raise the retirement age from 62 to 64.
Turnout at the previous nationwide demonstration on Jan. 31 was estimated by the ministry at 1.2 million and by the CGT at 2.8 million.
In Paris, where the ministry counted 57,000 demonstrators, police forces used tear gas to disperse the crowds that sparked clashes. By 6 p.m. local time, 17 people had been arrested.

The French multinational electricity company EDF said that more than 30 percent of its employees were on strike at midday on Tuesday, which had greatly affected electricity production by late Tuesday morning.
The mobilization remained strong in TotalEnergies where, according to the CGT, the strike rate varied between 75 percent and 100 percent.
Although deliveries of petrol products from TotalEnergies sites were interrupted, the company's management said that there was ""no lack of fuel"" in the group's service stations.

Established institutional racism and redlining in the United States have made neighborhood walkability a moot point for populations of color, according to a recent study.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- Despite living in neighborhoods with higher walkability scores, Black, Hispanic, and Asian people were less likely to engage in physical activity near their homes, said a recent study from the Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH).
This trend was tied to differences in other built environmental factors, like perceived safety and neighborhood quality, that could discourage individuals from going outside near their homes, said the researchers of the study, which was published in the journal Obesity.
It pointed out that established institutional racism and redlining in the United States have made neighborhood walkability a moot point for populations of color.
""In cities and counties across the U.S., the legacy of racial residential segregation and policies like redlining resulted in poorer built physical activity environments, characterized by decreased walkability, street connectivity, and green space, and increased pollution that disproportionately impact communities of color,"" the study's lead author, Monica Wang, ScD, associate professor of community health sciences at BUSPH, said in a public statement.

"Rescue efforts intensify as devastating earthquakes kill about 5,000 in TÃ¼rkiye, Syria","ANKARA/DAMASCUS, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- The international community has pledged support for TÃ¼rkiye and Syria after devastating earthquakes jolted vast swathes of the two neighboring countries on Monday. Rescuers are braving harsh weather and the risk of more quakes to save survivors from the wreckage.
About 5,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands injured as of Tuesday noon by the devastating earthquakes that could also be felt in Lebanon, Cyprus, Israel and other surrounding countries.
Aid and condolences poured in from world leaders as TÃ¼rkiye and Syria called on the global community to help.
HEAVY CASUALTIES, LOSSES
A magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck TÃ¼rkiye's southern province of Kahramanmaras at 4:17 a.m. local time (0117 GMT), followed by a magnitude 6.4 quake minutes later in the southern province of Gaziantep and a magnitude 7.6 earthquake at 1:24 p.m. (1024 GMT) in Kahramanmaras.
At least 78 aftershocks were recorded, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said Monday. Meteorological authorities monitored several magnitude 5.0 or stronger tremors in the afternoon.

In TÃ¼rkiye, the death toll climbed to 3,419, at least 20,534 others were injured, and more than 5,775 buildings destroyed, according to official data.
In the wake of the deadly quakes, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared national mourning for a week, saying, ""Turkish flag will be hoisted at half-mast until sunset on Sunday all around TÃ¼rkiye, at all foreign representations.""
More than 1,500 people died, and some 3,500 were injured in Syria, according to the Syrian health ministry and local authorities.
Historic sites in Syria were affected. ""Parts of the Ottoman mill in the Citadel"" of Aleppo have collapsed, and the defensive walls have cracks, said Syria's antiquities and museums directorate.
Monday's earthquake is believed to be the strongest in TÃ¼rkiye since the magnitude 7.9 tremor in eastern Erzincan Province left 33,000 people dead in 1939.
Earthquakes frequently strike TÃ¼rkiye due to its tectonic location. In 2020, the country recorded almost 33,000 earthquakes in the region, including 332 at magnitudes of 4.0 and higher, the country's emergency authority said.
The country should undergo a massive campaign to reconstruct cities threatened by natural disasters, Turkish seismology expert Ovgun Ahmet Ercan told the media.
HORRIFYING MOMENTS
In TÃ¼rkiye, residents who had fled from their homes in pajamas and T-shirts were waiting on streets covered by ice and snow. Many people were trying to leave the quake-hit areas, causing traffic jams and hindering emergency efforts, TÃ¼rkiye's NTV reported.

In northern Syria's Aleppo Province, one of the worst-affected Syrian areas, people have yet to recover from shock and panic.
In the Karm al-Jabal neighborhood in the provincial capital of Aleppo, local resident Muhammad Boushi was overwhelmed by the shock, not knowing what to do with his brother's family trapped under rubble.
Boushi was luckily awakened by the tremor and fled his house before it collapsed. ""We felt the earthquake and immediately took to the streets. Everyone left and took shelter on the streets. And we heard that buildings had collapsed, so we came to help,"" he told Xinhua.
""The civilians started to help rescue people from under the rubble, whether dead or alive. My 37-year-old brother, his wife, and their three children are still under the rubble. We are trying to contact them via mobile phone. It's ringing, but no one is answering,"" Boushi said anxiously.
""Around 4:30 in the morning, homes started to shake, so we woke up and went down to the streets. We heard a bang, and we rushed to see what was going on and tried to help. I hope all those under the rubble stay alive,"" said Mahmoud Muhammad, who lives in the nearby al-Shaar area.
Mamdouh Barot, another resident in the area, told Xinhua he and his family left their apartment before it started to crumble. When they got to the street, their building's upper floors collapsed in front of their eyes.
Barot lived on the ground floor and risked returning to grab some belongings. ""When I came out, I heard a big noise. So we ran, not daring to look back. When we returned there later, we found the building had totally collapsed,"" he said.
RESCUE UNDERWAY
TÃ¼rkiye issued a level-4 alarm after the earthquake, which included a call for international aid.
The Turkish Red Crescent and the country's emergency authority have dispatched rescue teams to the stricken area. The Turkish security forces, search and rescue volunteers and local rescue personnel also participated in the quake-relief work.

Some 3,500 soldiers have participated in rescue operations, Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said, noting 17 aircraft loaded with aid supplies are flying to the region from Istanbul, Izmir and Ankara.
The Turkish Defense Ministry has set up an air corridor to facilitate search and rescue teams to reach the disaster sites.
Disaster and Emergency Management Authority President Yunus Sezer said nearly 15,000 rescue personnel and about 5,000 vehicles and construction equipment had been deployed in the region.
However, a winter blizzard and freezing conditions hampered search and rescue efforts. Current temperatures were colder than seasonal averages, below 10 degrees Celsius in most affected regions. The weather service forecasted rain and sleet across southeastern TÃ¼rkiye until Thursday.
The Syrian government has set up a 24-hour central operation center led by Prime Minister Hussein Arnous to coordinate earthquake relief operations. All relevant ministries, institutions and authorities were on alert, state news agency SANA reported.
In Aleppo, rescuers used bulldozers and shovels to pry open building rubble to search for survivors in the region enveloped by snow and rain on Monday. Some rescuers struggled to pull casualties out of the debris with their bare hands.
In Hama Province in central Syria, rescue work continues, with shelters secured for people who lost their homes in the earthquakes, Interior Minister Mohammad Khaled al-Rahmoun told Xinhua at the site of a collapsed building in the province's al-Arabeen neighborhood.
Standing by a seven-story building in Hama, home to 100-150 people, Alaa Shaker, coordinator of the emergency unit at the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, said only 45 of the dwellers had been rescued.
""We have reports on deaths between 15 and 20 people under the building,"" he added.
INTERNATIONAL AID
World leaders have expressed solidarity with the people of TÃ¼rkiye and Syria and their condolences to the families of the victims, pledging to mobilize support.

""My heart goes out to the people of TÃ¼rkiye and Syria in this hour of tragedy,"" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in a statement after the quakes. ""The United Nations is fully committed to supporting the response. Our teams are on the ground assessing the needs and providing assistance.""
China has launched an emergency humanitarian assistance mechanism and will provide emergency aid to quake-hit TÃ¼rkiye and Syria, said Deng Boqing, deputy head of the China International Development Cooperation Agency, on Tuesday.
China will provide the first batch of emergency aid worth 40 million yuan (about 5.89 million U.S. dollars) to TÃ¼rkiye, sending a rescue team and a medical team in the shortest time, he added.

Iran, Lebanon, India, Egypt, Russia, France, Finland and other countries worldwide have also expressed their readiness to help TÃ¼rkiye and Syria.
More than 100 Russian rescuers have arrived in TÃ¼rkiye to assist in the aftermath of the deadly earthquakes, the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations said on Tuesday.
Algeria and Libya pledged to send rescue workers to help with the aftermath. Israel said it would dispatch two rescue teams to TÃ¼rkiye following the request of the Turkish government.
Erdogan said Ankara has received offers of help from some 45 countries.

ANKARA/DAMASCUS, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from Monday's devastating earthquakes climbed to 5,434 in Trkiye and 812 in Syria on Tuesday, while calls mounted to lift the U.S. sanctions on Syria.
The number of injured rose to 31,777 and 1,449 respectively in Trkiye and Syria, according to Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca and the media office at the Aleppo governorate headquarters.
The death toll in both countries is expected to rise further as the rescue operations are hampered by bad weather.
A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck Trkiye's southern province of Kahramanmaras at 4:17 a.m. local time (0117 GMT) on Monday, followed by a magnitude 6.4 quake a few minutes later in the country's southern province of Gaziantep and a magnitude 7.6 earthquake at 1:24 p.m. local time (1024 GMT) in Kahramanmaras.
Trkiye's southern province of Hatay and Syria's northern Aleppo city suffered the biggest loss of lives, while Lebanon, Israel and Cyprus also felt the tremor.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared a three-month state of emergency on Tuesday in 10 of the country's provinces hit by the quakes.
The decision was taken in order to ensure that search and rescue activities and subsequent studies can be carried out quickly, he said at a press conference.
CALLS FOR LIFTING U.S. SANCTIONS
As the rescue effort was underway in quake-hit regions, the Syrian Foreign Ministry on Tuesday slammed the U.S. sanctions for blocking the humanitarian work and rescue operations in the war-torn country.
In a statement, the ministry said that the Syrians, while dealing with the earthquake catastrophe, are digging among rubbles with their own hands or using the simplest tools as the equipment for removing the rubbles is banned by the U.S. sanctions.
It also said that the Syrians are also denied access to medicines and medical equipment that would help them face dangers and diseases.
Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) President Khaled Hboubati on Tuesday called for lifting the U.S. and Western sanctions on Syria to facilitate relief efforts as the country is in dire need of rescue equipment.
Speaking at a press conference in Damascus, the Syrian capital, Hboubati stressed that the SARC needs equipment, ambulances and heavy machinery, but ""the main obstacle is the sanctions imposed on Syria, which we demand to be lifted immediately.""
The Iranian Foreign Ministry on Tuesday called on different countries to pressure the U.S. to lift the sanctions on Syria.
The ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani made the remarks in an exclusive interview with the semi-official Mehr news agency on Monday, parts of which were released on Tuesday.
He urged other countries to force the U.S. to lift the siege of the Arab state so that international humanitarian aid can be delivered to the quake-stricken people without any obstacle and at the shortest time.
INTERNATIONAL AID POURS IN
Two days into the deadly earthquake, more countries joined the rescue and relief efforts underway in Syria and Trkiye.
Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, president of the United Arab Emirates, has ordered an aid package totaling 100 million U.S. dollars for earthquake relief in Syria and Trkiye, which will split the aid equally, the Emirates News Agency reported on Tuesday.
Also on Tuesday, Saudi Arabian King Salman bin Abdulaziz and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the operation of an air bridge to provide various aid to help the earthquake victims in Syria and Trkiye.
The official Saudi Press Agency reported that the air bridge will provide health, shelter, food and logistical assistance to alleviate the effects of the earthquake on the Syrian and Turkish people.
Jordan, for its part, sent on Tuesday humanitarian aid and rescue teams to Syria and Trkiye to help search for survivors.
Lebanon, bordering Syria, also sent on Tuesday morning a delegation to its neighbor to assist the rescue operations in Syria.
Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi made separate phone calls to his Turkish and Syrian counterparts on Tuesday, extending his condolences to the victims of the deadly earthquakes. On the same day, Egypt sent five military planes loaded with medical supplies to both quake-stricken countries.
Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on Tuesday also made separate phone calls to his Turkish and Syrian counterparts, expressing readiness to offer assistance for the relief efforts.
Iran has already sent three batches of humanitarian aid to Syria, Iranian Ambassador to Damascus Mehdi Sobhani was quoted by the semi-official Tasnim news agency as saying on Tuesday.

Key facts U.S. deliberately ignores about African debt,"BEIJING, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- Like many senior U.S. officials who have visited Africa, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen did not fail to target China and raise concerns about China's role in the debt problem during a recent visit to the continent.
While hyping up the bizarre ""Chinese debt trap,"" the U.S. officials deliberately ignored some key facts about African debt.
WHO HOLDS MOST AFRICAN DEBT?
According to the World Bank's International Debt Statistics, multilateral financial institutions and commercial creditors hold nearly three-quarters of Africa's total external debt.
A report published last July by the British NGO Debt Justice showed that 12 percent of the external debt of African countries is owed to Chinese lenders, compared to 35 percent to Western private lenders. The average interest rate of these private loans is 5 percent, compared with 2.7 percent for loans from Chinese public and private lenders.
""Western leaders blame China for debt crises in Africa, but this is a distraction. The truth is their own banks, asset managers and oil traders are far more responsible, but the G7 (the Group of Seven) are letting them off the hook,"" said Tim Jones, head of policy at Debt Justice.
In Chad, for example, the Swiss multinational commodity trading and mining company Glencore possesses about one-third of the country's external debt, while for Zambia, the American multinational investment company BlackRock is a major creditor, reported the French daily newspaper Le Monde on Jan. 30.
While calling for immediately addressing Zambia's heavy debt burden with China, Yellen deliberately ignored the fact that multilateral financial institutions and commercial creditors hold most of the country's external debt.
According to figures released by Zambia's Ministry of Finance and Planning, multilateral financial institutions account for 24 percent of the country's foreign debt, while predominantly Western commercial lenders account for 46 percent.
""Western lenders for long have not been put on the spotlight for debt relief because they successfully managed to dupe the world that it's only Chinese lenders that pose a threat to Africa,"" Uganda-based Vision Group journalist Mubarak Mugabo said.
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEBT CRISIS?
The causes of the debt crisis are multifaceted: the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, a decline in global economic growth and economic structure vulnerabilities, among many other things, could all exacerbate the debt situation of some African countries.
Persistent inflation, prolonged tightening of global financial conditions, the high cost of capital, domestic currency depreciations and lower financial inflows could increase the risks of debt distress in some African countries, according to Africa's Macroeconomic Performance and Outlook published in January 2023 by the African Development Bank (AfDB).
In particular, the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate hikes and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar have greatly added to the debt service burden of African countries, the AfDB pointed out. For example, Ghana's currency, the cedi, depreciated more than 33.4 percent against the U.S. dollar in 2022.
Since most of the debt that emerging and low-income countries should be paid in a foreign currency, notably the U.S. dollar and Euro, irresponsible U.S.-government policies have added fuel to the fire.
In contrast, China has been an ardent supporter of the Group of 20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative. The country has signed agreements or reached consensus with 19 African countries on debt relief and has suspended the most debt service payments of any G20 member. China has also actively addressed the debt of Chad, Ethiopia and Zambia on a case-by-case basis within the G20 framework.
""They depict China as a predatory lender that is weaponizing capital in order to practice a new form of colonialism in Africa. However, such accusations have little factual basis,"" noted Costantinos Bt. Costantinos, professor of public policy at the Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia.
""The debt trap issue has been a political smear,"" said Charles Onunaiju, director of the Nigeria-based Center for China Studies, adding that such claims are just a red herring to absolve the West of any responsibility.
WHO CONTRIBUTES MORE TO AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT?
During trips to Africa, American officials may not have realized that when they disembarked from a plane, they were likely headed toward a terminal built by a Chinese company. And their cars were also driving on roads or bridges built by a Chinese contractor. Modern infrastructure built by China is ubiquitous across Africa.
The increase in debt stock could also be a positive sign, and not just a pathology, according to an article published in June last year on the website of The Africa Report. Many sub-Saharan African economies experienced record growth before the pandemic. When gross domestic product increases, it is normal for debt to follow.
Suppose external debt contributes to a country's economic and social development in the long term and can be adequately managed. In that case, it could be called good debt, or in other words, financial aid for development.
Therefore, debt growth is only a trivial aspect of the problem. The rub is how to help African countries achieve sustainable, independent and high-quality development resulting in a balance of development financing and debt growth.
""China's financial assistance to Africa is largely aimed at realizing socio-economic and cultural projects of great importance, such as road infrastructure, hospitals, schools, bridges, etc.,"" Amadou Diop, a Senegalese expert on China, told Xinhua.
Statistics showed that since the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation was founded almost 23 years ago, Chinese companies have built or upgraded more than 10,000 km of railways, nearly 100,000 km of roads, roughly 1,000 bridges and 100 ports, and several hospitals and schools in Africa, creating more than 4.5 million jobs.
Published last July by a fellow in South Africa's University of Fort Hare, a quantitative study of the impact of China's loans on growth in 15 African countries concluded that China's efforts in developing infrastructure translate into economic growth.
According to the study, China has been and continues to be a significant force in assisting African countries in financing their development.
A survey issued last year by the Inter Region Economic Network, a Kenya-based think tank, found that China takes a substantial lead in decision-making and timely completion of infrastructure projects such as roads, power dams, railways and bridges in Africa. Facts and figures in the study showed that through efficient action, China tangibly contributes to Africa's development.
""There is a common feeling among African countries,"" said Ezzat Saad, director of the Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs, ""that China is a reliable partner, and there is a great trust and credibility in China-Africa cooperation.""

Feature: Human experiments -- chilling crimes behind walls of U.S. prison,"PHILADELPHIA, United States, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- When Allen Hornblum began to work as a literacy instructor in Philadelphia's prison system in 1971, he immediately noticed something unusual and chilling behind the walls.
Many inmates at Holmesburg Prison, most of them being African American men, had patches or gauze pads on their backs. Later, Hornblum found out those were the results of longtime and extensive human experimentations.
""It really is a very dark mark on Philadelphia's history,"" Hornblum told Xinhua during a recent interview outside Holmesburg while describing the prison, given the nickname The Terrordome, as ""arguably the largest human experimentation center in the United States.""
The human trials were led by a dermatologist named Albert Kligman associated with the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). Hornblum, author of two books on the horrifying subject -- Acres of Skin and Sentenced to Science -- said that though the prisoners signed up to get paid for partaking in Kligman's research programs, they didn't really understand to what risk they would be exposed.
""The inmates were not particularly sophisticated. The vast majority of them were unschooled,"" Hornblum said based on interviews with dozens of prisoners and years of in-depth research after giving up his job in the Philadelphia Sheriff's Office in 1993. ""Even though they were the subjects, they were not told what they were being injected with or having rubbed on them.""
Government records show that from 1951 to 1974, hundreds of Holmesburg inmates were intentionally exposed to pharmaceuticals, viruses, fungus, asbestos, and even dioxin. Many of the ""test subjects"" were awaiting prosecution, and attempting to save enough money to make bail. The experiments had different sponsors, including major pharmaceutical companies and the U.S. military.
""There were very few jobs in the jail. If you were lucky enough to get one, pushing a broom on a block, you may make 50 cents a day, 25 cents a day,"" Hornblum recalled. ""But if you were a test subject for Albert Kligman -- the lead doctor here -- you could make at least a dollar a day, in some cases, 1.5 to 2 dollars a day.""
In return for the slim payment, the inmates had to suffer from symptoms such as skin itching, rashes, discolorations, and fevers, and in some cases, they became more violent. Nevertheless, they ""were left somewhat incompetent until they recovered from whatever drugs they had been given,"" said the author.
""They were basically forgotten, the way doctors use lab rats or dogs or monkeys or chimpanzees. They may inject them with something. They may rub something on them. They monitor them for a while. When the experiment is over, they basically discard them,"" he said. ""Whatever took place here with radioactive isotopes or dioxin or the chemical warfare agents, there was no follow-up.""
After Acres of Skin was published in 1998, Holmesburg's inmates learned what had gone on for the first time and started to gather together. Subsequently, Hornblum met Edward Anthony, a test subject ""in a series of very, very nasty, unethical experiments that basically destroyed his life, or at least that portion of his life.""
When Anthony got back on the street, he was ""still suffering in many ways,"" according to Hornblum, who later penned Sentenced to Science, ""basically one Black man's account of what happened to him as a human guinea pig.""
Like other victims, Anthony developed ""a great distrust of doctors and medical institutions,"" Hornblum revealed. ""They don't trust the medical community anymore because they saw how themselves and others were mistreated and used and abused.""
The Holmesburg victims filed suit but didn't get very far because of a statute of limitations in the state of Pennsylvania. Plus, Hornblum said these men ""were deceived"" and ""were made to file and sign their signature on waiver forms.""
In October 2022, the city of Philadelphia issued a formal apology for experiments conducted on African American inmates at Holmesburg, saying that ""this is yet another tragic example of disgraceful and unethical practices of medical experimentation on people of color throughout our country's history.""
Penn's School of Medicine -- where Kligman was a long-standing faculty member in the Department of Dermatology before his death in 2010 -- apologized in 2021 ""for the pain Dr. Kligman's work caused to incarcerated individuals, their families, and our broader community.""
""Penn Medicine acknowledges that the work done by Dr. Kligman was terribly disrespectful of individuals -- many of whom were imprisoned Black men -- denying them the autonomy and informed consent which the medical community now considers to be foundational underpinnings for conducting ethical research,"" it said in a statement.
Hornblum said he believes the apologies ""should have happened years, if not decades earlier"" and that there ""really is an egregious sin of commission and omission there"" because ""it's all happening after Americans Juris write the Nuremberg Code,"" a set of ethical research principles delimiting permissible medical experimentation on human subjects.
""The medical community disregarded it. They didn't feel it was helpful. They didn't feel it was consistent with exploring the great scientific quests and quandaries. They thought it was an obstacle. So they didn't abide by it,"" he said. ""That's basically the sad commentary of this that some very smart people shoved ethics away because they saw it as an imposition, as a problem, as something that's gonna block them from their scientific quests. And that's why there are so many instances in prison and other institutions where people were used as guinea pigs for medical experimentation.
Kligman, however, didn't appear to be remorseful for what he had done.
Hornblum, who once interviewed Kligman prior to the publication of Acres of Skin, said: ""I don't believe his attitude ever changed. He saw this as a way to do experiments ... He walked through the big front doors of that prison and all he saw throughout the prison were not inmates, not people, but as he said, acres of skin.""
Hornblum said, ""the American people, and particularly the medical community and the academic community, should recognize the egregious nature of what took place.""
""Some of their top doctors, scientists were part of a really outrageously destructive program to people. They basically used individuals -- African Americans, senior citizens, children with all sorts of learning disabilities,"" he said. ""They used them as raw material for experimentation and then discarded them.""

U.S. four-star general's war speculation sparks criticism,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- Recent comments by a four-star general of the U.S. Air Force that the United States and China will fight a war in 2025 over Taiwan have been criticised as groundless speculation.
Mike Minihan, commander of the Air Mobility Command (AMC), said in a memo sent to his subordinates that his ""guts"" told him that the United States and China ""will fight in 2025,"" basing on self-claimed scenarios.
Minihan's comments triggered criticism from both military experts and public commentators in the United States.
Responding to the comments by Minihan, who leads the Air Force's responsibility for transporting soldiers and weapons onto battlefields and refueling U.S. military aircraft mid-air, the U.S. Defense Department said in a statement that the general's assertions ""are not representative of the department's view on China.""
""There's no reason for the bilateral relationship -- the most consequential bilateral relationship in the world -- to sort of erupt into some kind of conflict,"" said John Kirby, the National Security Council's coordinator for strategic communication, when asked to comment on the matter.
Even the direct recipients of Minihan's memo found it astonishingly ridiculous. U.S. military news portal Military.com quoted pilots and officers within the AMC as saying that predictions and corresponding directions contained in the memo are unrealistic and ""inappropriate.""
""Some of my airmen are going to get scared when they read this memo,"" one of the officers said.
Anti-war activist and podcast host Jimmy Dore said in an appearance on Fox News that the United States' enemy is not China, but rather ""the military industrial complex fleecing this country to the tunes of hundreds of billions and trillions of dollars.""
Dore said what's actually running the United States is a ""war machine"" that ""can not be stopped,"" leaving the American people who cheer for war with no idea whatsoever about their country's foreign policy.
""What is worse, they have no idea that they don't have any idea what is happening with the foreign policy.""
""Americans have no idea how corrupt our government is. They think our government is just regular corrupt ... that's not (the case) -- the whole thing is corrupt,"" Dore said.
Having plunged the Middle East into constant war over the past 20 years, the United States, Dore said, is ""doing a proxy war in Ukraine"" that both itself and its allies admitted has been provoked by the West.
""Now we're trying to sabre-rattle this with China, and (those in the industrial-military complex) are 'predicting a war,'"" Dore said. ""Again, China won't invade us. China is not our enemy.""
""I remain skeptical,"" said George Friedman, founder and chairman of Geopolitical Futures. ""The Pentagon has distanced itself from the general's remarks,"" he said.
Minihan was also criticized by Jude Blanchette, the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
The general's prediction -- together with similar speculations by other high-ranking U.S. military officials indicating ""various years"" in which a U.S.-China war would break out -- ""comes across as undermining the credibility of our statements and our assessments on precisely the relationship where your words matter,"" Blanchette said.

UN chief calls for actions to change course before meltdown occurs,"UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday called on countries to take decisive action to change course before it is too late to prevent a global meltdown from occurring.
While presenting his priorities for the year to the UN General Assembly, Guterres appealed for urgent action to achieve peace, economic rights and development, climate action, respect for diversity, and inclusive societies -- both today and for generations to come.
The Ukraine crisis, the climate emergency, rising nuclear threats and the undermining of global norms and institutions have pushed the world closer to annihilation.
Stressing the need for ""a course correction,"" the UN chief said taking action should be guided by the UN Charter, the organization's founding document, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
The secretary-general called for a holistic view of the peace continuum that identifies root causes of conflict and focuses on prevention, mediation, reconciliation, peacebuilding and greater participation of women and young people.
With poverty and hunger rising, developing countries drowning in debt, and social safety nets frayed, among other signs, the top UN official called for radical transformation of the global financial architecture.
The world must unite now to mobilize resources, said Guterres, so that developing economies have the liquidity to invest in education, universal healthcare, pandemic preparedness, decent work and social protection.
Countries are hurtling past the 1.5-degree limit on global temperature rise, therefore focus must be on the urgent priorities of cutting greenhouse gas emissions and achieving climate justice.
He said global emissions must be halved this decade, including through ""far more ambitious action"" in shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy, especially in the G20 group of top industrialized nations.
In respect to diversity and the universality of cultural rights, Guterres underlined the UN's commitment to protecting cultural rights and diversity.
""We will call for action from everyone with influence on the spread of mis- and disinformation on the internet -- governments, regulators, policymakers, technology companies, the media, civil society,"" he said.
Guterres also pledged to ""double down"" on support for measures towards greater gender equality, including quotas to close gaps in women's representation in elections, corporate boardrooms and peace negotiations.

CAIRO, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- Countries in the Middle East have pledged help and assistance to TÃ¼rkiye and Syria after powerful earthquakes rocked large swathes of areas along the Turkish-Syrian border.
Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi sent two separate messages to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after the earthquakes, expressing Tehran's readiness to provide immediate rescue and relief aid to the two countries.
In Beirut, where the tremors of earthquakes could be clearly felt, Lebanese caretaker Environment Minister Nasser Yassin said on Monday that ""a Lebanese rescue team will depart later in the day to TÃ¼rkiye, at the request of Turkish authorities, to help with rescue operations.""
The Lebanese Army Command announced that it will send 20 members of the Engineering Regiment to TÃ¼rkiye to contribute to the search and rescue work.

""We are sending two teams of professionals in order to help the victims,"" Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said in the statement. ""Today, Israel stands by TÃ¼rkiye in this difficult hour,"" he said.
In a separate statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the teams would be sent following the request of the Turkish government. ""I have directed the dispatch of search and rescue, and medical teams,"" he said.
The prime minister said that Israel will also send equipment to Syria, which would be a rare act of cooperation between Israel and Syria, two neighboring countries that have been in an official state of war.

California gun laws cannot stop mass shootings without federal support: The Guardian,"LONDON, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- The recent mass shootings in Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay in California showed that state gun laws alone cannot stop mass shootings without coordinated U.S. federal response, The Guardian said in an analysis.
California's gun laws include bans on the military-style assault weapons and large-capacity magazines that have been used in many mass shootings, the British newspaper said last week, adding that California is one of just two states, alongside New Jersey, to receive an ""A"" rating from the gun safety group Giffords, based on the strength of its firearm regulations.
While gun rights proponents have cited the two shootings as evidence of the ineffectiveness of California's laws, groups like Giffords fiercely reject those arguments. Gun safety groups have noted dramatic decline in firearm mortality rate in California in the years since tougher regulations were enacted, it said.
In a nation where firearms outnumber people, such horrific attacks will continue without a coordinated federal response to gun violence, it quoted the gun safety groups as saying.
""California is one state of 50,"" said Nick Suplina, senior vice-president for law and policy at the gun safety group Everytown. ""There's just no question that strong, uniform federal laws are substantially better than a mixed bag of strong and weak state laws.""

U.S. doctors demoralized by nation's health system: article,"NEW YORK, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- American physicians are now increasingly suffering from demoralization, which is not a reaction to a medical condition, but rather to the diseased systems they work for, said an article published on The New York Times website on Sunday.
The United States is the only large high-income nation that doesn't provide universal healthcare to its citizens. Instead, it maintains a lucrative system of for-profit medicine, said the opinion piece, authored by Eric Reinhart, a political anthropologist and physician at Northwestern University.
""For decades, at least tens of thousands of preventable deaths have occurred each year because health care here is so expensive,"" it noted.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the consequences of this policy choice have intensified. One study estimates at least 338,000 COVID deaths in the United States could have been prevented by universal health care, it said.
In the wake of this generational catastrophe, many health care workers have been left shaken, said the article.
""For me, doctoring in a broken place required a sustaining belief that the place would become less broken as a result of my efforts,"" but ""I couldn't sustain that belief any longer,"" Dr. Rachael Bedard was cited as saying about her decision to quit her job at New York City's Rikers Island prison complex during the pandemic.

Zhao Ming, head of the dispatched Chinese rescue team, said that the team immediately began to unload and transfer supplies after its arrival, and made contact with the Chinese embassy in TÃ¼rkiye, the local government, and relevant United Nations organs as soon as possible.
Zhao noted the team was informed of the latest developments in the rescue work and took on specific search and rescue tasks, adding that it planned to dispatch a squad to conduct an on-site survey in the task area and choose a safe and suitable location to set up camp.
âThe China Search and Rescue Team has been certified as a heavy Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) team by the United Nations. With well-trained personnel and good resources, the team is able to carry out rescue work at two different locations at the same time,â said Wang Mo, deputy head of the dispatched Chinese rescue team.

Feature: Race against time to find survivors at epicenter of TÃ¼rkiye's massive earthquakes,"KAHRAMANMARAS, TÃ¼rkiye, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- Rescuers were racing against time and a bitter cold to find survivors in Kahramanmaras, the epicenter of two huge and deadly earthquakes that struck TÃ¼rkiye and Syria on Monday.
""We have found survivors here, but also corpses. We can't abandon the search, the next hours will be crucial to find people still alive,"" Mehmet, a Turkish rescuer, told Xinhua on Tuesday.
His team was searching for trapped residents under a mound of rubble that used to be the Ebrar apartment complex, flattened by two powerful tremors.
Once in a while, they ask anguished people who gathered around the rubble searching for family members or volunteers to remain completely silent as they listen out for someone to call for help.
Residents were asleep when a magnitude 7.7 quake jolted Kahramanmaras and several other neighboring provinces before dawn.
A second earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck several hours later, complicating rescue efforts.
""The problem here is that if there are other survivors, they had to endure the cold which can cause hypothermia, and their chances of survival are getting slim,"" Mehmet noted.
The rescuer explained that the complex that collapsed like a house made of cards was home to some 120 residents, most of whom are still believed to be under a mass of metal and concrete.
Throughout Monday, dozens of major aftershocks rattled the region.
The latest official death toll from the massive earthquakes in TÃ¼rkiye stood at 5,894 with 34,810 injuries early Wednesday. Over 6,000 buildings have collapsed, but authorities believe that the actual number is much higher.
Thousands of rescue workers were scattered across the vast quake-hit zone, which covers 10 provinces of TÃ¼rkiye, home to around 13.5 million people.
But as the quakes have also seriously disrupted the zone's infrastructure, making highways and roads inaccessible, some cities were left mostly unattended, Xinhua correspondents witnessed.
Rescuers worked through the cold winter night in the hope of being able to find more survivors, but as time went by, the chance of finding people alive was diminishing.
Turkish social media users were also using Twitter to relay to authorities and rescue teams the exact locations of many people who used their cell phones to locate where they were trapped underneath the buildings.
Survivors of the biggest disaster that TÃ¼rkiye has witnessed for nearly a century were trying to live in their cars as there was no electricity and no other buildings left to accommodate them in Kahramanmaras.
But gasoline was scarce, and heating remained a serious problem, so did drinking water.
In Gaziantep, Adiyaman and Malatya, three provinces hit by the quakes, survivors took shelter in community centers where they were given blankets and food, television channels reported.
Mosques in the region were also opened to provide shelter.
""Because the debris removal efforts are continuing in many buildings in the earthquake zone, we do not know how high the number of dead and injured will rise,"" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Monday in a televised address in the capital Ankara.
The World Health Organization warned that the death toll in the two countries could end up surpassing 20,000.
The earthquake-stricken region in TÃ¼rkiye is also home to hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees who have fled the civil war in their homeland.

"Racism, abuse of weapons fuel gun violence in U.S. society, says Egyptian expert","CAIRO, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- Heba Gamal, a member of the Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs, has condemned frequent shooting incidents in the United States, saying they are driven by a ""deep-rooted culture of racism, bullying, white supremacy and the proliferation of arms.""
""American laws that permit 18-year-old citizens to freely and easily possess weapons, even war arms, is the main reason for exacerbating the problem,"" Gamal, also an associate professor of Comparative Politics at the Cairo-based state-run Institute of National Planning, told Xinhua in a recent interview.
Violence, she said, has become part of American society and culture, with murder scenes often seen in TV series and movies.
""Amid high rates of crimes, streets have become unsafe, especially at night,"" Gamal said, adding that the rising poverty and persecution rates add more fuel to the fire.
Deeming violence a deep-seated problem in the U.S. society, she said, ""Violence is part of the American culture and society,"" and those who immigrated from Europe in history assaulted the indigenous people (Native Americans).
Commenting on democracy and human rights, Gamal considered them ""slogans that have not built a homogeneous community.""
Targeting people of color indicated that ""racism is a well-established culture in the U.S. mentality,"" the expert said, referring to the murder of George Floyd, an African-American man, in the city of Minneapolis by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer.
""Colored people are the main victims of the American violent society,"" she said, holding the belief in white supremacy to be a major reason for the profound racism in the United States as U.S. former President Donald Trump ""supported such a concept and many groups eventually appeared to defend the rise of those racist ideas.""
She said that the ""vicious circle of violence and shooting will continue,"" not only because the arms trade is a pillar of the U.S. economy, but also the existence of weapons lobbies and the spread of organized crime groups that boost violent attacks.
Human rights groups have called on the U.S. Congress to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons and warned against the rising violence.
""It is a profitable trade. I do not think the Congress will pass a law on prohibiting sales of weapons for civilians,"" she said, questioning whether it is ""logical for ordinary people to own war weapons.""
The repetition of violent attacks signals ""ignorance of the U.S. administration of human rights and protection of children and youth from murder,"" Gamal said.
Weapon sellers are the most influential and richest people in the United States. Both Republicans and Democrats in the Congress need donors for their campaigns, and here the arms lobby plays a significant role in this process, the expert explained.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Joe Biden delivered his State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday night amid a sour public mood.
This is Biden's second State of the Union speech since he took office in January 2021 and the first of its kind before a divided Congress with Republicans taking control of the House of Representatives after last year's midterm elections and Democrats still running the Senate this term.
The primetime remarks came a week after a Gallup poll showed that most Americans remain downbeat on the way things are going in the United States, with only 23 percent saying that they are satisfied while more than three-quarters are dissatisfied.
Meanwhile, Biden's overall job performance rating continues to be underwater. According to U.S. poll tracker FiveThirtyEight, the Democrat's approval rating stood at 43.2 percent as of Tuesday, while disapproval of the job he's doing stood at 52.3 percent. More Americans are holding a negative view of his handling of the country's economy.
Biden, nevertheless, devoted a swath of his speech on Tuesday to the economy, touting indicators like low unemployment and slowing inflation rates. However, inflation in the United States is still at a high level rarely seen in past history and many economists remain concerned that the U.S. economy will fall into a recession later this year.
Biden also used the speech to call upon Congress to raise the debt ceiling. The federal government reached its borrowing limit last month and is trying to avoid going over the 31.4 trillion-U.S. dollar debt ceiling and defaulting on its current obligations.
House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who sat behind Biden during his speech to a joint session of Congress alongside U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, said on Monday that ""defaulting on our debt is not an option"" but ""a responsible debt limit increase that begins to eliminate wasteful Washington spending and puts us on a path towards a balanced budget is not only the right place to start.""
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has recently warned that a U.S. default ""would cause significant damage"" to the global economy.
""It will be very damaging for U.S. consumers if the U.S. defaults, that would push interest rates up,"" Georgieva told CBS News during an interview. ""And if people don't like inflation today, they're not going to like at all what may happen tomorrow.""

""UNFPA is committed to support the people of TÃ¼rkiye and Syria affected by the earthquakes, including the pregnant women who are expected to give birth in the coming weeks under these difficult conditions,"" said Natalia Kanem, UNFPA Executive Director. ""Their ability to access quality care before, during and after delivery must not be an afterthought.""
Thousands of buildings, including UNFPA-supported maternity facilities, youth centers and women's and girls' safe spaces, have collapsed or been severely damaged. UNFPA's immediate priority is to re-establish services that are critical to the health, well-being and protection of women and girls, according to a press release.
UNFPA has offices and operations in the affected areas and was immediately on the ground assessing the impacts and preparing to support the emergency response in coordination with the authorities and partners, with additional personnel on standby for deployment.
Despite logistical challenges, UNFPA has already started delivering reproductive health services to earthquake survivors through existing delivery points in TÃ¼rkiye and is also distributing dignity kits, containing basic hygiene items.
In Syria, according to the release, blankets and warm clothes in addition to dignity kits are being provided to women and girls in need. Mobile health teams and field clinics have been deployed to provide reproductive health and protection services to affected people in the four worst-hit governorates, where women and girls' safe spaces will also be established.
The provision of cash payments, which ensure women and girls can access health services and information, including for gender-based violence prevention and response, will be rapidly assessed and provided based on funding availability, according to the release.
Prepositioned life-saving reproductive health supplies, including medicines to manage obstetric emergencies, will be distributed in affected areas this week, the release said.

Limited road access and a shortage of trucks have hindered international rescue teams from entering the work sites. Turkish authorities are considering mobilizing helicopters and trucks from other provinces farther away.
GENEVA, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- The extensive damage to infrastructure caused by the earthquakes in TÃ¼rkiye and Syria is hindering aid efforts by the United Nations (UN) agencies, officials said on Tuesday.
The first international disaster assessment and coordination teams had now arrived at Adana airport in TÃ¼rkiye, UN officials told a press briefing in Geneva. The teams were due to move to Gaziantep, the epicenter of the first quake, on Tuesday.
However, there is limited road access and a shortage of trucks to transport them to worksite. Turkish disaster authorities are therefore considering mobilizing helicopters, and trucks from other provinces farther away.
A UN representative on the ground told Tuesday's press briefing via video link that so far, some 8,000 people had been rescued by search and rescue teams.

""The recent earthquake is an absolute hammer blow for the people of TÃ¼rkiye and displaced people in the region, notably Syrians, who had already suffered more than a decade of war and are being lashed by an economic crisis and winter storms,"" a UNHCR official said.
More than 1.7 million of the 15 million people inhabiting the ten Turkish provinces most affected by the earthquakes are Syrian refugees, according to UNHCR. In some of these provinces, one in two is a refugee.
TÃ¼rkiye has hosted the world's largest refugee population since 2014. Around 4 million refugees and asylum-seekers are in TÃ¼rkiye under temporary and international protection.

NEW YORK, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- There is still much work to be done in the United States to address deep-rooted hate and discrimination against Asian Americans about one year after multiple deadly cases sending shocking waves across the country.
Key initiatives included in the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which was signed into law by U.S. President Joe Biden in May 2021, have yet to be launched, according to a report by USA TODAY on Tuesday.
The legislation was designed to curb anti-Asian hate crimes by creating a position at the Justice Department to expedite a review of COVID-19-related hate crimes; providing grants for states to create hotlines for reporting hate crimes and for law enforcement training aimed at preventing and identifying hate crimes; and directing federal agencies to work with community organizations to help raise awareness about hate crimes during the pandemic.
Biden is scheduled to deliver his second State of the Union address on Tuesday evening and it's not clear if he will mention violence and hate towards the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community as he did in his first State of the Union address.
""Racism against Chinese Americans and the AAPI community isn't new. It's existed in the United States for nearly 200 years, despite the many contributions that Chinese Americans have made to the United States in fields such as healthcare, science, technology, business and the arts,"" said Zhengyu Huang, president of the Committee of 100, a nonprofit leadership organization of prominent Chinese Americans.

""Chinese Americans are still seen as the perpetual foreigner, strangers in our own homeland. And post COVID, reports of discrimination, racism, and violence towards Americans of Chinese and Asian descent have significantly increased -- and these are only the incidents captured or reported,"" Huang told Xinhua via email in a recent interview.
Trigger events like the COVID-19 and irresponsible comments from former U.S. President Donald Trump led to the surge of discrimination against Asian Americans, according to Haipei Shue, president of United Chinese Americans (UCA), a nonpartisan and nonprofit coalition based in Washington, D.C.
There have been bias and stereotypes against Asian Americans throughout the history of the United States and the issue of hate against Asian Americans may not be tackled in a short time, said Shue in a recent interview with Xinhua.
Shue noted that the stabbing of an Asian student from Indiana University by a white woman on Jan. 11 was apparently racial motivated.
""We are a nation of immigrants with a history of discrimination and exploitation of minority groups. We are still learning from the mistakes of the past. Asian Americans have contributed mightily to the success of the United States but there is still much work to be done to treat Asian Americans as Americans,"" said Huang.
The fight against racist words and actions of certain politicians and leaders towards the Asian American community as well as long-held stereotypes is staged on a daily basis, Huang added.

Though progresses were made in the fight against discrimination in the past decades in the United States, it's surprising to see how fast setbacks took place in recent years, said Shue.
The education system and literature in the United States don't talk much about the original sin of racial discrimination in U.S. history, Shue noted.
Michelle Alyssa Go's death was a call to action for many, including those who see the crime Martial Simon committed as an example of ongoing anti-Asian hate, said Michelle's father Justin Go in a recent piece run by The New York Times on the anniversary of her death.
Michelle Alyssa Go was shoved to her death by homeless man Martial Simon on Jan. 15, 2022 at the subway station in Times Square.
It has been sad and physically exhausting to constantly hear and see the never ending strident voices spewing hatred over social media, said Justin Go.

""Whatever freedoms we give to people, possessing such personal rights does not mean we can abandon people like Martial Simon to our subway systems,"" said Justin Go, who acknowledged progress has been made to help homeless people in New York.
Everybody in the neighborhood was a little bit traumatized just from everything that went in 2022, said Brian Chin, a resident in Chinatown in Lower Manhattan.
Chin is the former landlord of Korean-American woman Christina Yuna Lee, who was stalked and stabbed to death by homeless man Assamad Nash in her apartment on Feb. 13, 2022.
The hate and discrimination against Asian Americans still is a problem and there still seems to be a lot of hatred, Chin told Xinhua in a recent interview.
""Hopefully, 2023 is better, but 2022 at least was a very bad year for all Asians... It seems like there's more and more hate crimes in New York City happening against Asians every week. It's a very troubling time,"" said Chin.

UNEP says anti-microbial resistance threat to global health security,"NAIROBI, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- The growing crisis of antimicrobial resistance presents an existential threat to the health of humans, animals, food crops, and the natural world, says the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in a report launched in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi on Tuesday.
Partly fueled by untreated waste emanating from mechanized agriculture and healthcare industries, antimicrobial resistance could trigger up to 10 million deaths annually by 2050, similar to the 2020 rate of global cancer fatalities, the report says.
In addition, the inability of drugs widely used to treat infections caused by pathogens like viruses, bacteria, and fungi could lead to an about 3.4-trillion-U.S.-dollar slump in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) annually, pushing an additional 24 million people on the verge of extreme poverty, according to the UNEP report.
Executive Director of the UNEP Inger Andersen noted that drivers of ecological degradation like pollution and biodiversity loss are also worsening antimicrobial resistance, to the detriment of the global sustainability agenda.
""The impacts of antimicrobial resistance could destroy our health and food systems. Cutting down pollution is a prerequisite for another century of progress toward zero hunger and good health,"" said Andersen.
Under the title of ""Bracing for Superbugs: Strengthening environmental action in the One Health response to antimicrobial resistance"", the report notes that industrial pollution, disruptions in the natural world, and extreme weather events are also behind the spread of superbugs, which are resistant to conventional drugs.
The global burden of antimicrobial resistance, if unchecked, could worsen poverty, gender inequalities, and food insecurity, the UNEP said, noting that listed antimicrobial resistance among the top ten threats to global health security.
""Failing to address the global burden of antimicrobial resistance, including its environmental dimensions, could take humanity back to an era when even mild infections could become deadly,"" the report says.
In a bid to tame the antimicrobial resistance crisis, the UNEP report proposes better management of waste from pharmaceutical and agriculture sectors, the use of degradable antibiotics, the establishment of a robust monitoring and regulatory regime, collaborative research, and public awareness.

Spain ends face mask mandate on public transport,"MADRID, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- People in Spain will no longer have to wear face masks on public transport from Feb. 8 after the decision was taken to end their obligatory use as a protection against COVID-19 during Tuesday's cabinet meeting.
The decision is the latest towards the normalization of life in Spain after the COVID-19 pandemic, with the obligatory use of facemasks in most indoor settings ending on April 20, 2022, and outdoors a year ago, on Feb. 10.
""We are following the roadmap that we planned to return to normality,"" Spain's Minister for Health, Carolina Darias, told journalists.
Face masks will, however, still have to be worn in hospitals, health centers and pharmacies ""due to the vulnerability of the people who are there,"" the minister said.
The country's epidemiological situation is steadily improving, Darias said.
On Feb. 3, the 14-day notification rate of new COVID-19 cases in the country's population aged 60 years and over stood at 50.76 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, almost 50 points lower than the 97.60 cases per 100,000 inhabitants registered on Jan. 20.
Currently, 2,056 people are hospitalized with the virus, 150 of them in intensive care. Since the start of the pandemic, 118,712 people have lost their lives to COVID-19 in Spain.

Black Americans suffering from Long COVID have trouble accessing care: ABC News,"

There is a history of distrust when it comes to the Black community and the health care system due to beliefs among patients that doctors won't treat them as well as their white counterparts.
NEW YORK, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Black Americans have made up a disproportionate share of cases, hospitalizations and deaths compared to any other racial or ethnic group, and now, doctors and advocates are warning that the Black community is facing another barrier: access to Long COVID care, reported ABC News on Monday.
According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey, with the latest update conducted between Jan. 4 and Jan. 16, 28.7 percent of Black respondents said they currently have or have had Long COVID.
One Black Long COVID patient ChimÃ©re Smith, a 40-year-old former middle school English teacher from Baltimore, Maryland, said she paid more than a dozen visits to doctors and hospitals asking for help, but was discharged after every visit with no treatment plan in place.
""There is a history of distrust when it comes to the Black community and the health care system due to beliefs among patients that doctors won't treat them as well as their white counterparts. A 2012 meta-analysis found Black patients were 22 percent less likely than white patients to receive any pain medication,"" said the report.
Long COVID occurs when patients who were infected with the COVID-19 virus have lingering symptoms for more than four weeks after recovering. In some cases, these symptoms can persist for months or even years.

Length of stay is longer because people are needing more acute care.
NEW YORK, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- The winter triple threat of flu, COVID-19 and RSV is easing across the United States, but hospitals are still about as full as they've ever been during the pandemic and that doesn't seem likely to change any time soon, reported CNN on Monday.
Hospitals were facing capacity and resource challenges long before the pandemic hit, experts were quoted as saying, in large part because the people who are being admitted are sicker than they were before.
""It's been a continuing trend over the last decade or so that there's been this greater acuity of patients inside the hospitals,"" said Nancy Foster, vice president for quality and patient safety with the American Hospital Association.
""So what you see is this incredibly sick group of people inside of hospitals. If you're a doctor or nurse or respiratory therapist or pharmacist or any other health professional working inside the hospital, that means it's always a difficult puzzle you're trying to solve to help that patient out,"" she noted.
A mix of complicating factors were exacerbated during the pandemic, experts said, straining resources more than ever.
""Length of stay is longer because people are needing more acute care. Because of work force pressures, there are not as many people who can be treated in an inpatient setting all at once,"" Aaron Wesolowski, vice president of policy research, analytics and strategy at the American Hospital Association, was quoted as saying.

When it comes to victims, Black Americans are twice as likely as white Americans to die from gun violence and 14 times more likely than white Americans to be wounded.
NEW YORK, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- An average of 110 Americans die daily from gun violence, far above the rate of gun deaths for any comparable nation, according to a recent USA Today report.
The United States has about 12 gun deaths for every 100,000 residents, almost four times the rate of the next-highest country, Switzerland, said the report, citing experts.
Most mass shootings were carried out by white shooters, according to the informatics group Statista. Mass shootings are just a small subset of all gun violence though.
Accidental shootings, at times deadly, are often perpetrated by children, according to the gun-limits group Everytown for Gun Safety. Last year, children committed at least 321 accidental shootings, killing 143 people.
When it comes to victims, Black Americans are twice as likely as white Americans to die from gun violence and 14 times more likely than white Americans to be wounded, the report quoted the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence as saying.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- More and more U.S. travellers are putting guns in their carry-on bags at Southern California airports, a U.S. local newspaper reported last Thursday.
In 2018, one gun was found out of 584,187 boarding passengers on average, according to the Orange County Register, citing data from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).
In 2021, the behavior became more common, as one gun was seized for every 226,764 boarding passengers, it said.
""It's possible that more people are carrying guns routinely, partly a response to an increasingly tense and volatile political environment and relaxed laws in some states around both open and concealed carry,"" said David S. Meyer, a sociology professor on gun policy and violence at UC Irvine.

Rescuers racing against time for 2nd day to search survivors in quake-hit TÃ¼rkiye,"

ANKARA, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- Rescuers in quake-hit Trkiye are beating the clock and battling heavy rain to save survivors from rubbles on Tuesday, as more than 24 hours have passed since massive earthquakes wreaked havoc in the country's southeast.
The death toll from Monday's powerful earthquakes in southern Trkiye rose to 3,549, said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan upon declaring that a three-month state of emergency is enacted in 10 affected provinces.
Meanwhile, the number of wounded people stood at 21,103, Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Authority said in an update.
Two major earthquakes of 7.7 and 7.6 magnitudes hit the province of Kahramanmaras Monday. At least 78 aftershocks were recorded, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay has said.
Turkish NTV broadcaster warned that the toll could rise dramatically as foul weather hampered the rescuers in the south while increasing the risk of hypothermia among those who remained under the rubble overnight.
News footage from NTV showed dozens of rescuers and volunteers searching through the ruins of multi-story apartment blocks through the night under the snow in the southeastern Diyarbakir province.
Mosques, gymnasiums, and schools were opened for people who might need to take shelter. However, power aftershocks have kept many people from staying indoors.
TV footage displayed people from Kahramanmaras spending the night in cars, some wrapped themselves in blankets to repel the freezing weather.
Turkish authorities have dispatched a total of 12,181 search and rescue workers to the quake zones, including 3,294 foreign emergency personnel sent by 14 countries, Oktay said on Tuesday.
The emergency operations are being hampered by a winter blizzard as the temperatures recorded as minus 10 degrees Celsius in most of the 10 affected provinces.
At least 5,775 buildings were damaged and more than 8,000 people have been pulled out of the rubbles, but the teams were also struggling with ""extremely severe weather conditions,"" Oktay said.
The magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck Trkiye's southern province of Kahramanmaras at 4:17 a.m. local time (0117 GMT) on Monday, followed by a magnitude 6.4 quake a few minutes later in the nearby Gaziantep Province, and a magnitude 7.6 earthquake at 1:24 p.m. local time (1024 GMT) in the Kahramanmaras Province.
The quakes were also felt in Lebanon, Israel and Cyprus.
Trkiye's southern province of Hatay bordering Syria suffered the most loss of life in the earthquake with at least 872 casualties.
In Hatay, roads and an airport runway were ruptured and numerous buildings, including two hospitals, collapsed in the quake.
Hatay Mayor Lutfu Savas told Halk TV broadcaster that search and rescue teams could only arrive in the namesake city till Tuesday morning due to ruined roads and blocked transportation amid heavy snow.
He stressed that there was also a serious communication problem in the city.
The Port of Iskenderun district in Hatay continues to burn with massive flames after some containers started burning for an undetermined reason on Monday, the semi-official Anadolu Agency reported.
Firefighter efforts to control the flames continue, but locals still share images of dense black smoke rising from the port.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday declared seven days of national mourning for the victims.
Monday's earthquake is believed to be the strongest in Trkiye since the magnitude 7.9 tremor in eastern Erzincan Province that killed 33,000 people in 1939.
In 1999, a magnitude 7.4 earthquake struck central and western Trkiye on Aug. 17. Later on Nov. 12, a magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck western Trkiye. The two earthquakes killed around 18,000 people, injured 43,000 others and left 600,000 people homeless.
Trkiye sits at the intersection of three major tectonic plates: the African plate, the Eurasian plate and the Arabian plate, and around 42 percent of its territory is situated in a seismically active region, which is why the country is so prone to earthquakes.

Expressing sympathy to the Turkish and Syrian governments and peoples, Kanaani noted that the related Iranian authorities have voiced readiness for sending rescue and medical aid to the two countries.
For more than the past nine years, Syria has been grappling with conflict and is under special circumstances at present, said the spokesman, urging other countries to force the United States into lifting the siege of the Arab state so that international humanitarian aid can be delivered to the quake-stricken people without any obstacle and at the shortest time.
The United States has imposed economic sanctions against Syria, which also make it a herculean task to send essential goods and international humanitarian aid to the country.
Around 5,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands injured as of Tuesday noon after strong earthquakes jolted parts of TÃ¼rkiye and neighboring Syria early Monday.

""We preserve and strengthen this cohesion by preparing decisions confidentially first before communicating them,"" he said, referring to the recent decision taken by Germany and the U.S. on the delivery of battle tanks.
Due to increasing pressure on Germany by NATO partners to supply heavy artillery to Ukraine, the German government decided in late January to deliver 14 Leopard 2 tanks, and to permit partners to re-export from their Leopard stocks. In addition, the export of up to 178 of the older Leopard 1 tanks was later approved.
The U.S. followed suit shortly afterward, with President Joe Biden announcing the delivery of Abrams battle tanks to Ukraine.

Rates of infection are particularly high among people who are Black or Hispanic or who have a lower socioeconomic status.
NEW YORK, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- Patients with failing kidneys who need regular dialysis treatments still have sky-high rates of dangerous staph infections in their blood compared with people who don't need these treatments, according to a new Vital Signs report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
""Rates of infection are particularly high among people who are Black or Hispanic or who have a lower socioeconomic status,"" CNN reported early this week, quoting the Vital Signs report.
More than half a million Americans rely on regular dialysis treatments to filter toxins from their blood because their kidneys are no longer working as well as they should. Dialysis relies on the use of catheters and needles which circulate a patient's blood through a machine in order to clean it.
""Germs like staph can get into the patient's bloodstream via these access points,"" Debra Houry, acting principal deputy director of the CDC, said during a news briefing on Monday. ""These infections can be serious or deadly, and some are resistant to some of the most common antibiotics used to treat them.""
The study shows that between 2017 and 2020, patients on hemodialysis had an annual rate of bloodstream infections caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus that was 100 times higher than adults who are not on dialysis -- 4,248 infections for every 100,000 person years compared with 42 of 100,000 person years, respectively.

A newborn named Muhammed Dogan Bostan was plucked alive from the rubble in the Elbistan district of Kahramanmaras Province on Wednesday, the semi-official Anadolu Agency reported with the images showing him sucking his thumb while being pulled from the ruins of a building.
The two-month-old's mother was also pulled from the wreckage and taken to hospital.
In the southern province of Hatay, a 28-year-old woman named Merve was rescued alive from the rubble of a collapsed five-storey building by the rescue teams 48 hours after the earthquake, the Demiroren News Agency reported.
A total of 3,356 people have so far been killed in the earthquakes in Hatay, registering the highest death toll among the 10 affected provinces, where about 6,000 buildings were flattened, according to the latest figures.
Images on social media showed dozens of dead bodies lying wrapped with blankets on the side of the road near the remains of the damaged Iskenderun hospital in Hatay.
Residents ran out of their homes in their pajamas after the ground shook early Monday. Tens of thousands, whose homes were not destroyed in the quake, do not feel safe in buildings as aftershocks continue to shake the foundations and sleep in their cars with a lack of temporary accommodation.
International search and rescue teams, including an 82-member Chinese rescue team that arrived in TÃ¼rkiye on Wednesday, have poured into the quake zone to assist in rescue efforts in the country.

Ukrainian president visits Britain for defense cooperation,"LONDON/KIEV, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was in the United Kingdom (UK) on Wednesday to discuss defense cooperation. This was his second visit outside his country since the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
Zelensky addressed both houses of the UK Parliament after meeting Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at 10 Downing Street. He then met King Charles III at Buckingham Palace.
In his speech in Parliament, Zelensky thanked the UK for its support and appealed for fighter jets.
The UK government said in a statement on Wednesday that it had already trained 10,000 Ukrainian troops to ""battle readiness"" over the past six months and would ""upskill"" a further 20,000 this year, without mentioning the provision of jets.
A spokesperson said Sunak had tasked Defense Secretary Ben Wallace with investigating what jets Britain might be able to give Ukraine, noting that this will be a ""long-term solution"" rather than ""a short-term capability.""
According to Ukraine's presidential press service, Zelensky and Sunak exchanged views on the peace plan proposed by Kiev, as well as on Ukraine's Euro-Atlantic integration and post-conflict reconstruction.
Zelensky was also scheduled to visit Ukrainian troops undergoing military training in South England.
Late on Wednesday, he will travel to France to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the French Presidency said.
Zelensky visited the United States and met President Joe Biden in December 2022.

TÃ¼rkiye activated the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, which is designed for any country in Europe and beyond to request assistance from the EU member states in case of need, after a powerful earthquake struck the southern part of the country on Monday.
A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck TÃ¼rkiye's southern province of Kahramanmaras at 4:17 a.m. local time (0117 GMT) on Monday, followed by a magnitude 6.4 quake a few minutes later in the country's southern province of Gaziantep and a magnitude 7.6 earthquake at 1:24 p.m. local time (1024 GMT) in Kahramanmaras.

TÃ¼rkiye's southern province of Hatay and Syria's northern city of Aleppo suffered the heaviest loss of lives. Lebanon, Israel and Cyprus also felt the tremor.
The EU received a second request from TÃ¼rkiye on Wednesday morning. Ankara asked for tents, blankets and heaters, according to Lenarcic.
Syria also activated the EU Civil Protection Mechanism on Wednesday morning, requesting assistance for their own search and rescue services, as well as medical and food items, Lenarcic said. The EU member states have been encouraged to respond favorably to Syria's requests.

Moscow rejects U.S. claims on Russia's failure to comply with New START,"MOSCOW, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- Moscow strongly rejects claims made by the United States on Russia's alleged non-compliance with the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), the Russian Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.
""The Russian side categorically rejects the claims made by U.S. representatives regarding our country's 'non-compliance' with the provisions of the New START,"" it said in a statement, adding that detailed official explanations on the issue were passed on to the U.S. side through diplomatic channels.
""We do not intend to leave the hostile actions of the United States unanswered,"" said the ministry, noting the United States has restricted all opportunities for Russia to conduct unimpeded inspections on U.S. territory, thereby violating the treaty.
While the treaty is guided by the principle of indivisible security and by the concept of building strategic relations based on mutual trust, openness and predictability, the policies of the United States are ""diametrically opposed"" to all those goals, the ministry said.
""The Russian side reaffirms its unwavering commitment to the START, as an instrument for maintaining international security and stability,"" it added.
The New START, the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty in force between the two nuclear superpowers, can be extended by a maximum of five years with the consent of the two countries. Russia and the United States officially extended the treaty by five years on Feb. 3, 2021.

"Biden addresses to divided Congress amid sour public mood, low approval rating","WASHINGTON, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Joe Biden delivered his State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday night amid a sour public mood and his low approval rating.
This is Biden's second State of the Union speech since he took office in January 2021 and the first of its kind before a divided Congress, with Republicans taking control of the House of Representatives after last year's midterm elections and Democrats still running the Senate this term.
UNDERWATER PERFORMANCE
The primetime remarks came a week after a Gallup poll showed that most Americans remain downbeat on the way things are going in the United States, with only 23 percent saying that they are satisfied while more than three-quarters are dissatisfied.
Besides, Biden's overall job performance rating continues to be sinking. According to U.S. poll tracker FiveThirtyEight, Biden's approval rating stood at 43.2 percent as of Tuesday, while disapproval of the job he's doing stood at 52.3 percent. More Americans are holding a negative view of the Democrat's handling of the country's economy.
Biden, nevertheless, devoted a swath of his speech on Tuesday to the economy, touting indicators like low unemployment and slowing inflation rates. However, inflation in the United States is still at a high level rarely seen in past history and many economists remain concerned that the U.S. economy will fall into a recession later this year.
Biden also used the speech to call upon Congress to raise the debt ceiling. The federal government reached its borrowing limit last month and is trying to avoid going over the 31.4-trillion-U.S.-dollar debt ceiling and defaulting on its current obligations.
House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who sat behind Biden during his speech to a joint session of Congress alongside Vice President Kamala Harris, on Monday although said ""defaulting on our debt is not an option,"" but added ""a responsible debt limit increase that begins to eliminate wasteful Washington spending and puts us on a path towards a balanced budget is not only the right place to start, it's the only place to start.""
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has recently warned that a U.S. default ""would cause significant damage"" to the global economy. ""It will be very damaging for U.S. consumers if the U.S. defaults, that would push interest rates up,"" Georgieva told CBS News during an interview. ""And if people don't like inflation today, they're not going to like at all what may happen tomorrow.""
POLITICAL DISCORD
Biden sought to set a bipartisan tone in Tuesday's address by calling for unity and cooperation between Democrats and Republicans, saying that ""fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.""
During the first two years of Biden's presidency, political discord continues to grow, with two parties seeing eye-to-eye on a string of major issues, such as abortion rights, gun violence, immigration, policing reform, climate change, and health care.
Republicans -- who control the House on Capitol Hill this term -- are determined to counter Biden's and the Democratic Party's agenda, dimming the prospect of any major legislation on those issues being approved by Congress despite the president's political overtures.
""In the radical left's America, Washington taxes you and lights your hard-earned money on fire, but you get crushed with high gas prices, empty grocery shelves, and our children are taught to hate one another on account of their race,"" Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders responded when delivering the Republican rebuttal after Biden's speech.
The parents of Tyre Nichols, a black man who was brutally beaten by a group of police officers in Memphis, Tennessee after a traffic stop exactly a month ago and died days later, were in attendance for Biden's address.
The death of Nichols revived the painful memory of the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Floyd, also a black man, died on May 25, 2020, after an encounter with Minneapolis police, during which a white officer knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes while making an arrest with other colleagues.
""What happened to Tyre in Memphis happens too often,"" Biden said on Tuesday. ""Imagine having to worry whether your son or daughter will come home from walking down the street or playing in the park or just driving their car.""
While reflecting on the suffering of Nichols, Biden asked U.S. lawmakers to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which would make it easier to prosecute police officers for misconduct but has stalled due to partisan disagreements.
U.S. Congressman Jamaal Bowman, a Democrat from New York, has recently complained that tribalism in politics is preventing police reform and that people are literally dying as a result.
Since the start of this year, the United States has suffered a spate of mass shootings across the country. Biden urged Congress to ""ban assault weapons once and for all"" on Tuesday but it's unlikely for Republicans -- who, in general, support gun rights and are opposed to more restrictions to carry firearms -- to come on board with the idea.
POLARIZED, DIVIDED NATION
Biden's latest remarks to Congress also took place against the backdrop of Republicans-led House investigations of his alleged mishandling of classified documents and before his announcement to run for reelection.
Former U.S. President Donald Trump -- who lost to Biden during the 2020 race but has refused to concede -- has already launched a third White House bid while being investigated for his dealing with classified documents.
""It must be noted how extraordinary these circumstances are: Both the current and former president are under investigation for similar causes as they prepare to run against one another next year,"" Douglas Schoen, a political consultant who served as an adviser to former U.S. President Bill Clinton, wrote in an opinion last month.
""There is now a level of uncertainty and instability that is problematic for the president, his party and indeed for our increasingly polarized and divided nation,"" Schoen underscored.
In remarks directly addressing Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States Oksana Markarova, who was seated in the audience as a special guest in the House chamber on Tuesday, Biden claimed ""America is united in our support for your country.""
The United States constantly funneling weapons -- of which the degree of lethality has only increased day by day -- into Ukraine since the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict nearly a year ago has met with criticism from commentators and pundits.
Accusing his own government of saber-rattling, U.S. anti-war activist Jimmy Dore said recently that ""we're doing a proxy war in Ukraine, which we provoked ... We have admitted we provoked it."" ""Who is running the country? The war machine,"" Dore added.

UN says 8.3 mln people require humanitarian aid in Somalia,"MOGADISHU, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 8.3 million people require humanitarian assistance in Somalia where significant segments of the population are on the brink of famine, the United Nations relief agency said Wednesday.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that in the absence of adequate funding and enhanced capacity, famine is projected between April and June in the three population groups including Baidoa and Burhakaba rural districts as well as internally displaced people (IDPs) in Baidoa and Mogadishu.
""Somalis are hungrier, sicker, and more vulnerable than a year ago, pushing an ever greater number of people into reliance on humanitarian assistance for survival,"" OCHA said in its latest update on the humanitarian situation in Somalia.
It said even if no famine emerges, the humanitarian situation is extremely alarming since more than 6.3 million Somalis are expected to face high levels of food insecurity between January and March, including 322,000 in catastrophic levels of food insecurity.
""The cumulative levels of excess mortality could be as high as in 2011 when almost 260,000 people lost their lives, at least half of them children. In 2022 alone, 1,049 children died in nutrition centers and many more without even accessing the centers,"" OCHA said.
The crisis is caused by the historic failure of four consecutive rainy seasons, persistent conflict, displacement, and high food prices that have left millions of people at risk and are pushing people in Somalia to the brink of famine.
OCHA said the current drought is the longest and most severe in recent history and has surpassed the 2010/2011 and 2016/2017 droughts in terms of duration and severity.
It also said the recent escalation of the military offensive against al-Shabab, in addition to ongoing political and inter-clan tensions, has resulted in significant humanitarian impacts including increased displacement and reprisal attacks.
""Overall, it is expected that up to 450,000 additional civilians will be displaced due to conflict in 2023,"" it warned, noting that protection concerns include widespread forced family separation, indiscriminate attacks against civilians, freedom of movement restrictions, forced recruitment, abductions and destruction of civilian infrastructure.
OCHA believed the ongoing military operations offer both an opportunity for expanded access into areas previously under al-Shabab control as well as the increased likelihood of widespread insecurity and acute deterioration of humanitarian access.
""This uncertainty will require partners to exercise flexibility in programming to adapt to shifting insecurity, to assess and provide assistance in newly recovered areas as well as to engage in coordinated advocacy for the protection of civilians,"" OCHA said.

The risk of violent death and injury observed in the zip codes studied was almost entirely borne by individuals from minoritized racial and ethnic groups.
NEW YORK, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- Young adult males from zip codes with the most violence in Chicago and Philadelphia had a notably higher risk of firearm-related death than U.S. military personnel who served during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study of 129,826 young adult men living in four cities -- Chicago, Philadelphia, New York City and Los Angeles -- in 2020 and 2021 found that men ages 18 to 29 in the most violent zip code of Chicago and Philadelphia faced a higher risk of firearm-related homicide than U.S. soldiers who were deployed to Afghanistan, with risk ratios of 3.23 and 1.91, respectively.
The risk of violent death and injury observed in the zip codes studied was almost entirely borne by individuals from minoritized racial and ethnic groups: Black and Hispanic males represented 96.2 percent of those who were fatally shot and 97.3 percent of those who experienced nonfatal injury across the 4 settings studied.
The study came as firearms surpassed motor vehicle accidents as a cause of death for children, adolescents and young adults in the United States, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The U.S. public health agency said 3,597 children died by gunfire in 2021.
Overall, gun violence remained endemic in the United States in 2022, including 648 mass casualty shootings, a near-record, according to Gun Violence Archive, a website that tracks gun violence in the country. The first month of 2023 saw more than 50 mass shootings across the nation, defined as an incident in which four or more people were wounded or killed, not including the shooter.

ANKARA/DAMASCUS, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- The number of fatalities from Monday's devastating earthquakes that struck TÃ¼rkiye and Syria has surpassed 12,000, as chances have become smaller to find more survivors in cold weather before the golden 72 hours are over.
Rescuers and volunteers are working round the clock to locate the trapped under rubble as the survival rate without food or water drops drastically after the 72nd hour, which is rapidly approaching. Experts have warned that the 72-hour window for rescuing those trapped by the earthquakes may be much smaller than anticipated, given the low temperatures that have swept through the earthquake-hit regions will increase the risk of hypothermia.
According to the latest statistics, Monday's devastating earthquakes in southern TÃ¼rkiye and northern Syria have killed 9,057 people in TÃ¼rkiye and 3,480 in Syria.
SEARCH UNDERWAY
The search and rescue teams from more than 65 countries have arrived in the Turkish earthquake zones to offer assistance in quake-relief efforts, according to an official statement.
A plane carrying a 83-member rescue team from China and 20 metric tons of disaster relief materials and equipment arrived in the city of Adana in southern TÃ¼rkiye in the early hours of Wednesday. In addition to materials and equipment for search and rescue, communication and medical treatment, they also brought with them four rescue dogs.
Volunteers flocked to southern TÃ¼rkiye hit hard by the earthquakes. Photographs show terminals crowded with volunteers trying to help, while the roads leading to the affected areas were clogged with long queues of vehicles ready to transport supplies or offer assistance.
""It was good that we came. When we arrived, the area was rubble everywhere,"" said a volunteer who identified himself as Kerem Okyay, a businessman from the central Turkish city of Sivas who hurried to Elbistan, a town about 200 km away.
Located in the southern Turksih province of Kahramanmaras, Elbistan was the epicenter of the 7.6-magnitude quake that rocked the region on Monday and close to the town of Pazarcik, the epicenter of a 7.7-magnitude one hours earlier.
""We formed a team with some friends as soon as we heard the news of the earthquake and came here as volunteers,"" Okyay told Xinhua.
Soon after their arrival, the team saved two people from the debris. ""We were focusing on areas where we could hear people,"" he said.
In the heavily damaged city center of Kahramanmaras, the name-sake capital of Kahramanmaras Province, sniffer dogs equipped with small GPS-enabled harnesses were leading rescuers in the search for survivors from site to site in the winter cold.

MORE AID POURING IN
While rescue operations are taking place in TÃ¼rkiye and Syria, more countries have committed to providing assistance.
A Lebanese ministerial delegation headed by Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib arrived in Damascus on Wednesday to discuss with Syrian officials more possible aid for earthquake-stricken Syria.
On Wednesday, Tunisia sent its third aircraft, which was packed with tonnes of emergency humanitarian aid including food, medication, blankets and clothing, to Syria. Two military planes from Tunisia were already sent to the two earthquake-stricken countries on Tuesday, carrying medical teams, rescue teams, and urgent humanitarian aid.
Saudi Arabia launched on Wednesday a donation campaign to help earthquake victims in Syria and TÃ¼rkiye. According to local press, a total of 25 million Saudi riyals (6.7 million U.S. dollars) had been donated to the campaign so far.
Jordan announced on Wednesday that it would send aid convoys over the next few days to quake-hit areas in Syria and TÃ¼rkiye, while Sudan said its Civil Defense Forces is ready to send a specialized team to TÃ¼rkiye to help with rescue efforts.
David Saranga, head of the Israeli aid delegation to TÃ¼rkiye, said on Wednesday that two Israeli rescue teams are searching for survivors in the country, while a field hospital complete with 15 Israeli aircraft and about 230 personnel is expected to be established by Thursday or Friday, according to the Israeli military and foreign ministry.

TURKIYE'S QUAKE RESPONSE BACK TO NORMAL
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan admitted on Wednesday that there were some problems in the first-day response to the earthquakes.
Operations are currently back to normal, Erdogan said in Kahramanmaras Province, the state-run TRT broadcaster reported.
Earthquake victims can temporarily stay in hotels in the Mediterranean tourism hub of Antalya and southern province of Mersin, he added.
The Turkish president announced that each quake-stricken family would receive 10,000 Turkish liras (531 U.S. dollars), and new homes will be built in the 10 provinces affected by the disaster within a year.
Also on Wednesday, Erdogan said it was impossible to get prepared for a calamity like the earthquakes that struck the country on Monday, but he vowed to exert utmost efforts to save citizens' lives.
""There are deficiencies ... It is impossible to be prepared for such a major disaster,"" Erdogan told reporters in the southern province of Hatay, which was hit hard by the earthquakes.
""We will not leave any of our citizens unattended. We will carry out disaster management by taking every necessary step so that no one will suffer,"" he said.

"Fury boils over persistent U.S. sanctions on war-torn, now quake-hit Syria","DAMASCUS, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- Syria on Tuesday lambasted the United States for blocking humanitarian relief work in Syria, a day after massive earthquakes rocked northern part of the country and vast swathes of its neighbor TÃ¼rkiye.
In a statement, the Syrian Foreign Ministry said that Syrians, while dealing with the earthquake catastrophe, are digging among rubbles with bare hands or using the simplest tools, as the equipment for removing the rubbles has been banned by the United States.
Sanctions have been a main U.S. tactic toward Syria ever since the latter was listed as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1979. Since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, the United States and its Western allies have imposed a number of economic sanctions and restrictions that denied Syrians the means to pursue growth as well as access to daily necessities. U.S. sanctions intensified with the passing of the Caesar Act in 2019.
CALL FOR END OF U.S. SANCTIONS
Monday's strong earthquakes drained the already limited resources of Syria, where at least 2,470 were killed and 4,650 injured, according to data released by authorities and rescuers.
The city of Aleppo in northern Syria was among the hardest hit in the quake, with debris still constantly falling in the aftermath of Monday's earthquakes. And for lack of tools, some rescuers to dig through the rubble with bare hands in search of survivors in the snow and rain, Xinhua reporters witnessed.
Local residents are railing against the United States for retaining the economic sanctions when Syria desperately needs help from the international community.
Aisha al-Hilu, a school teacher, fled home with the kids after the earthquakes. All of their belongings were buried under the rubble.
She blasted the U.S. sanctions, which have cut off Syria's economic and financial ties with the rest of the world and impeded the country's access to quake relief supplies.
""These sanctions 'punished' us, but we didn't do anything. Shame on them ... They must remove these sanctions,"" she said.
Prior to the quakes, Syria was already hurt by a new round of U.S. sanctions. On Jan. 16, the Syrian Foreign Ministry condemned in a statement the United States for imposing new sanctions that hinder Syria's import of medical equipment and spare parts through ""inhuman measures.""
At a press conference held Tuesday in the Syrian capital Damascus, Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) President Khaled Hboubati called for lifting the U.S. and Western sanctions on Syria to facilitate much-needed relief efforts.
In an interview with the semi-official Mehr news agency on Monday, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani called on countries to pressure the United States into lifting the sanctions on Syria and the siege of the country to enable the delivery of international aid.
""The people of northern Syria are really suffering. Sanctions are stifling international relief and medical supplies. Thousands of deaths in Syria are preventible; earthquake relief should pause sanctions,"" tweeted Khaled Beydoun, associate professor of law at U.S.-based Wayne State University.
""Western countries don't need to send anything. Just remove lethal sanctions on Syria,"" tweeted Sharmine Narwani, a commentator and analyst of Middle East geopolitics and former senior associate at St. Antony's College, Oxford University.
OTHER U.S. WRONGDOINGS
After Monday's earthquakes, Washington has ruled out the possibility of dealing directly with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in quake relief efforts.
U.S. State Department Spokesman Ned Price on Monday told reporters that the United States will send aid to Syria through non-governmental organisations (NGOs) without engaging with the Syrian government, which it does not recognize as legitimate.
The accusation that Syria is a sponsor of terrorism is ""an old-school pretext"" that the United States often uses to justify its intervention in other countries, said Maher Ihsan, a journalist and political expert.
""Look at the situation now, the United States is controlling key gas and oil fields in oil-rich areas in Syria as well as key agricultural areas ... the United States didn't come here to help, but to take advantage of the situation and impose their own will,"" Ihsan told Xinhua in a previous interview.
After its direct military interventions in Syria in 2014, the United States has sent troops to oil-rich regions of Syria, including the northeastern province of Hasakah and the eastern province of Deir al-Zour.
Damascus has long blamed U.S. forces for stealing Syrian oil and other resources. Videos footages showing U.S. troops using tankers to transport Syrian oil to U.S. military bases in Iraq have been widely circulated online.
In August last year, the Syrian oil ministry accused the United States of stealing 83 percent of Syria's oil output in the first half of 2022. The average daily output of Syrian oil in the first half of 2022 was 80,300 barrels, while the U.S. forces and their ""mercenaries"" were stealing an average of 66,000 barrels a day, a ministry statement showed.
By plundering a significant percentage of Syria's oil supply, the United States has not only robbed Syria of its valuable resources direly needed for economic recovery and social construction, but also deprived average Syrians of crucial daily necessities in winter. Syrians have to endure inadequate heating and lengthy power outages during the chilly winter.
""The U.S. role in Syria has been destructive, to say the least,"" said Osama Danura, a Syrian political expert and former member of the Syrian government delegation to the Syria peace talks in Geneva. ""The economic circle in Syria has been damaged by such unilateral measures.""

Suffering of Syria caused by US further exacerbated by devastating earthquake: ambassador,"The death toll from the devastating earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria is continuing to climb. In an exclusive interview with the Global Times, Mohammed Hasanein Khaddam, Syrian Ambassador to China, said that the roots of Syria's suffering - the US' long-arm jurisdiction - are further exacerbated by the disaster.
The US long-arm jurisdiction wears political glasses, and targets ""non-malleable"" countries. Even in this shocking humanitarian calamity they failed to depoliticize their attitude, Khaddam said.
The US sanctions ""tightened the noose"" around the Syrian economy, and split the Syrian banks from the international financial system, so that you cannot trade with other countries and are even unable to buy medication and survival equipment, Khaddam told the Global Times on Thursday.
Syria has faced US sanctions since 1979, which have got worse since then. This has been their convoluted diplomacy in the Middle East that ""succeeded"" in keeping the crisis alive for decades, the envoy said. ""No wonder it has lost its credibility in the region even with its friends there.""
Unfortunately, the situation is really difficult and painful amid the earthquake, and the Syrian government mobilized all available resources for the afflicted areas, but the catastrophe is widespread, Khaddam said.
""Many people are still under the rubble,"" he said. Buildings and infrastructure have been hit hard. Tens of thousands became homeless because large numbers of buildings are dilapidated and uninhabitable due to the first quake and the aftershocks, so the number of deaths is in the thousands and on the rise, with hospitals and medical centers overstretched.
The Syrian government issued on the first day of the catastrophe an appeal calling on all countries, international organizations and funds, and governmental and non-governmental organizations to extend emergency assistance, especially search and rescue machinery and equipment, the ambassador said. ""The first priority is saving, then curing, sheltering and providing survivability means. Of course we feel deeply touched and grateful to all countries that sent condolences and provided or offered assistance.""
Fresh snowfall in Syria on Wednesday has compounded the already desperate situation faced by millions of people whose lives have been affected by the earthquake disaster, said the UN's top humanitarian official in the country.
On Wednesday, China urged the US to put aside its geopolitical obsession and immediately lift unilateral sanctions on Syria since Washington's long-term involvement in the Syrian crisis with military intervention and economic sanctions has resulted in a large number of civilian casualties and difficulties in economic development and the reconstruction process in the country.
The US should open the door to humanitarian aid in face of the catastrophe, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said.
Throughout the Syrian war, the US nourished and fostered terrorist groups and used them as tools to destroy Syria. The US has also been stealing Syrian oil and agricultural products, which incurred losses totaling more than $110 billion, in addition to imposing a blockade to suffocate the economy, the envoy said.
""This, no doubt, shows the roots of our suffering which is further exacerbated by the earthquake. These sanctions are deadly under the 'rule-based order',"" he said.
In terms of the quick response, many aid agencies in China, both governmental and nongovernmental, announced their intention to provide Syria generously with much-needed aid, the envoy said.
""There are now rescue teams from China on the ground. We also received many heartily compassionate messages and calls of support from the Chinese people, which are deeply overwhelming,"" he said. ""Many Chinese friends answered our call of appeal; many even came to the embassy to offer their compassion, which was truly touching.""
The Red Cross Society of China sent the first batch of medical supplies, which will meet the needs of 5,000 people, to the earthquake-stricken area in Syria from Beijing on Thursday morning, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Thursday.
Besides the cash and material assistance already announced, China is also speeding up the implementation of food aid programs to Syria, with 220 tons of wheat on the way to Syria and the remaining 3,000 tons of rice and wheat to be shipped in two batches in the near future, the ministry said.
""We feel inundated with compassion, and cannot thank enough these feelings and prompt responses at the official level and from the people, which mirrors the humane soul of the Chinese civilization,"" Khaddam said.

The resolution is largely symbolic and unlikely to reach the floor for a vote as House Republican leaders have so far declined to call on George Santos to resign.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- A group of House Democrats filed a resolution on Thursday, seeking to expel Republican lawmaker George Santos from the U.S. Congress.
""We gave him plenty of time to resign, and he has chosen not to do so,"" U.S. Congressman Robert Garcia, a California Democrat, told reporters.
Santos, the U.S. representative for New York's 3rd congressional district, has admitted to fabricating several aspects of his work history and education, following his election last year.
The embattled Republican freshman is facing several investigations but has refused to step down.
The resolution is largely symbolic and unlikely to reach the floor for a vote as House Republican leaders have so far declined to call on Santos to resign.
Santos and U.S. Senator Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, had a tense exchange shortly before U.S. President Joe Biden's State of the Union address on Tuesday night.
Romney later revealed that he told Santos that he did not belong there. Santos said on Wednesday that he thought Romney's comments were ""reprehensible.""
Expelling a member from the U.S. House of Representatives requires the support of two thirds of members under the country's constitution.

UN to launch flash appeal for donor support for quake-hit Syria,"
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres speaks to reporters on the earthquake in Trkiye and Syria at the UN headquarters in New York, Feb. 9, 2023.

UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday announced that the world body will launch a flash appeal for donor support for those affected by the earthquake in Syria next week.
""The earthquake that struck Trkiye and Syria is one of the biggest natural disasters in our times,"" Guterres told reporters, warning that ""we haven't yet seen the full extent of the damage and of the humanitarian crisis unfolding before our eyes.""
He pointed out that the earthquake struck as the humanitarian crisis in northwest Syria was already worsening, with needs at their highest level since the conflict began.
Guterres said that the first UN convoy, which included six trucks carrying shelter and other desperately needed relief supplies, crossed into northern Syria Thursday through the Bab al-Hawa crossing on the border with Trkiye.
""More help is on the way, but much more, much more is needed,"" he said, adding that the United Nations has done its best to race to respond and are committed to doing much more.
The UN's Central Emergency Response Fund has released 25 million U.S. dollars to jumpstart the response.
""By early next week, we will launch a flash appeal for donor support for those affected by the earthquake in Syria,"" Guterres said, adding that the United Nations is also ready to support the Turkish government's response ""in any way we can.""
Guterres said he has asked UN Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths to travel to areas affected by the earthquake this weekend.
Griffiths, already in Trkiye, will also visit Aleppo and Damascus in Syria to assess needs and see how the United Nations can step up support.
In addition to more resources, Guterres stressed the need ""to explore all possible avenues to get aid and personnel into all affected areas.""
""This is the moment of unity, not to politicize or to divide, but it is obvious that we need massive support,"" he told reporters. ""I would be very happy if in relation to the UN, there will be the possibility to do it also in as many crossings as possible.""
""This is a moment in which everybody must make very clear that no sanctions of any kind interfere with relief to the population of Syria in the present moment,"" he said.
Devastating earthquakes struck Trkiye and Syria on Monday, leaving nearly 20,000 people dead in the two countries so far, according to latest data.

US will never win competition with China through dirty tricks: China Daily editorial,"
U.S. President Joe Biden delivers his State of the Union address to Congress in Washington, D.C., the United States, Feb. 7, 2023. (Xinhua/Liu Jie)
In his State of the Union Address on Tuesday, US President Joe Biden reiterated that the United States seeks competition not conflict with China.
Although that makes his administration's China policy appear more focused and balanced than the administration's earlier clarion call based on competition, cooperation and confrontation, it is fundamentally unchanged. For that reason, the US' competition with China is essentially different from that with other countries, including its allies.
The latter is for economic benefits, while the former is aimed at the containment of China.
While the Biden administration claims that it does not seek to change China's system, it is not because it doesn't want to, but because it has failed to achieve that.
Likewise, the Biden administration's stance of not seeking conflict with China is because it has realized that conflict with China will definitely not leave the US unscathed.
Meanwhile, given the size of China and its close connections with the world economy, it would be extremely difficult for it to maintain the stability of its socioeconomic life, if the US succeeded with its attempts to decouple China from the rest of the world, particularly before it realizes self-reliance on key resources and technologies.
The Chinese side will by no means be hoodwinked by the word play of the Biden administration, which is in fact for domestic consumption rather than reflecting any real changes in its approach toward China.
His call that the nation should unite to win the competition with China was essentially in line with the rest of his speech in which he attempted to extend an olive branch to the Republicans.
Taking a tough line on China is one of the few things on which the two parties see eye to eye, and Biden is clearly hoping to leverage that to get support from the Republicans for other parts of his agenda. ""Winning the competition with China should unite all of us,"" he declared, getting to the nub of the problem: ""For the last few years our democracy has been threatened, attacked, and put at risk."" â threats and attacks that come, not from China or other countries, but from the intensifying feuding within the US itself, both its political system and society.
The purpose of true competition is to bring out the best of the competitors. It is not China that is trampling rough-shod over the rules-based international order, but the US with its tariffs, sanctions, clique building and proxy wars.
China is always open to cooperation with the US. And it is also open to competition that is based on the principles of mutual respect, fairness and justice, not long-arm jurisdiction and coercion.
Any competition that resorts to such dirty tricks is merely a form of conflict.

US urged to explain Nord Stream blasts after Pulitzer winner's probe,"Six months after the explosion of the Nord Stream gas pipelines which shocked the world, an article by veteran US investigative journalist Seymour Hersh has accused the US of being the culprit of the blasts.
Washington has denied the accusations without further explanation, but the article immediately prompted a fierce verbal confrontation between the US and Russia and making waves in geopolitics.
Given previous US behaviors, Chinese experts believe that the Hersh report is highly credible and Washington's denial cannot hinder Russia's determination to dig out more evidence from the report's value as a clue.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Wednesday urged the US to give an explanation over its role in 2022 explosion of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. ""The White House must now comment on all these facts,"" Zakharova said in a post on her Telegram page.
In response, White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said on Wednesday that the investigative article was ""utterly false and complete fiction,"" and the CIA and Pentagon also dismissed the allegation with similar rhetoric, according to media reports.
Hersh, an 85-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner, published the article on his personal website on Wednesday, stating the US military involvement of sabotaging the Nord Stream gas pipelines after senior White House officials' nine-month long plot inside the national security community.
Citing sources with direct knowledge of the plot, the article revealed many details of the operation: Explosives were planted by US Navy divers under the cover of the NATO maritime exercise; and a surveillance plane of NATO member Norway triggered the explosives on September 26, 2022 after US President Joe Biden greenlighted the operation.
Although there's no final verdict on who was responsible, the US, NATO, as well as investigators from Sweden and Denmark agreed it was ""a result of sabotage.""
Finding smoking gun
Some US media had blamed Russia as the likely culprit soon after the Nord Stream explosion in September 2022, but Hersh wrote that political elites from his country has more incentives to destroy the pipeline regarding their words prior to the incident.
On February 7, 2022, US President Joe Biden threatened that ""if Russian tanks or troops cross the border of Ukraine, there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2.""
At a press conference in September 2022 about the consequences of the worsening energy crisis in Western Europe, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken suggested halting Nord Stream is a ""tremendous opportunity to once and for all remove the dependence on Russian energy"" and stop Russia from ""weaponizing energy"" for political purposes.
If Biden were an ordinary citizen, and a tube explosion had happened somewhere in the US after Biden made those threats, his words would have been interpreted by the US procurator as a strong motive, and Biden would bear legal liability,LÃ¼ Xiang, an expert on US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday.
Hersh proved his credibility in his investigations on the 1969 massacre of Vietnamese civilians by US forces and US troops brutalizing Iraqi prisoners after the US invasion in 2003, which prompted LÃ¼ to believe in his latest investigation of the North Stream pipeline explosion.
""Even if it's not 100 percent accurate - exposure of such shady activity can hardly be 100 percent accurate - it's definitely not made up out of nowhere,"" LÃ¼ noted.
As of press time, US mainstream media including The New York Times and The Washington Post maintained silence on the matter, which is qualified to be top on a US newspaper's front page.
LÃ¼ suspected the consistent silence was a sound coordination between the US media and the US government, and the strategy is to deny it and wipe it from news portals even if their smoking gun was caught.
Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Thursday that as the US had used washing powder to accuse Iraq of possessing weapons of mass destruction, it's a genius of playing dirty.
Hersh's courage should be praised, yet analysts expressed concerns about his safety.
It is obvious that the US benefited most from the destroyed pipelines. ""If the US was behind the sabotage, definitely the Americans would have carefully planned how to destroy or hide the evidence and mislead the public,"" Li said.
LÃ¼ said that without an entity in legal sense to be in charge of such international disputes, it is almost impossible to establish a legal fact even if more evidence further support the point that the US was the culprit. But this investigative report will strengthen Russia's determination to dig out more evidence, he said.
Reactions to the blasts by some Western leaders also added to suspicion of US, including then British Prime Minister Liz Truss' texting ""it's done"" to Blinken and former Polish foreign minister's tweet ""Thank you, USA.""
In January 2023, Russia blamed that Sweden and Denmark, who were investigating holes in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, ""have something to hide"" and blocked Russia from engaging in the joint investigation.
""Whether or not the US is the culprit, Europe has acted too obedient. It is also tragic that as the Russia-Ukraine conflict intensifies, Europe has less and less room to bargain with US on security issues,"" Li said.
European politicians should reflect on whether blindly following the US would ultimately benefit Europe, or just the opposite, the expert said. He urged Europe to effectively strengthen autonomy. ""Otherwise incidents like the Nord Steam pipeline blasts could happen again, and the price will again be paid by Europe, not the US.""

Rescue teams spared no effort to search for more survivors on Thursday, though hopes faded quickly on the 4th day after two massive earthquakes jolted TÃ¼rkiye.
ANKARA, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- Rescue teams continued to spare no effort to search for more survivors trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings on Thursday, though hopes faded quickly on the 4th day after two massive earthquakes jolted TÃ¼rkiye.
The death toll from the devastating earthquakes climbed to 17,134 in TÃ¼rkiye, with 71,806 injuries as of Thursday, according to TÃ¼rkiye's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD).
The number of casualties is expected to increase further once the search efforts are over across a wide area of 10 provinces. Experts warned that the chances of saving lives have dropped sharply after 72 hours of the quakes that hit the country on Monday.

Still, the miracles of pulling out more survivors from under the rubble of collapsed buildings over 80 hours after the quakes were encouraging.
The state broadcaster TRT showed Turkish rescue teams pulling out a 60-year-old woman named Meral Nakir from the wrecks of a flattened apartment in Malatya on Thursday.
The injured woman was pulled from the rubble of a six-story building with the help of a trained dog ""Kopuk."" The Golden Retriever rescue dog had served in the same site for two days and saved six people.
In Antakya, Hatay, Chinese and Turkish rescuers successfully saved three women from the rubble of collapsed buildings on Thursday through their joint operations, during which two bodies of victims were also recovered.

The Turkish parliament approved the implementation of a three-month state of emergency on Thursday as called by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who said the state will use this authority to prevent malign acts of some people, such as looting, in the quake-hit regions.
Speaking in southern Gaziantep, one of the quake-affected provinces, the president said containers were being provided for temporary accommodation for those who lost homes due to the quakes, while pledging to build three- or four-story buildings in one year. He also promised to allocate 10,000 Turkish liras (530 U.S. dollars) each to the quake victims.
With an estimated 13.5 million people in the country affected by the massive quakes, Erdogan acknowledged there were shortcomings in the immediate response on the first day of the disaster.

A number of people have been left homeless in disaster areas. A call center was established for children whose families and relatives could not be reached in these areas. Hundreds of people from the quake-hit areas were dispatched to hospitals in other provinces.
As many volunteers flocked to the quake-hit zones to help the victims, roads leading to the affected areas were clogged with vehicles carrying supplies or relief aid.
International search and rescue teams, including an 82-member Chinese rescue team and several civilian teams, have arrived in TÃ¼rkiye to assist in the rescue efforts.

While the official China Search and Rescue Team was carrying out rescue operations in the southern province of Hatay, members of the Blue Sky Rescue Team, a Chinese civil rescue squad, rushed to help save trapped people in the Malatya province right after their arrival in TÃ¼rkiye early Thursday.
Some 6,479 personnel from 56 countries have arrived in TÃ¼rkiye to support the search and rescue efforts or provide humanitarian and medical aid, while rescue teams from 19 more countries will be in the country in 24 hours, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Thursday.
TÃ¼rkiye was rocked by a magnitude 7.7 earthquake early Monday, which was followed hours later by a second magnitude 7.6 quake, in the worst natural disaster ever seen in the country in the past decades.

Hatay was one of the hardest-hit areas by the massive earthquakes that jolted TÃ¼rkiye and neighboring Syria on Monday.
International rescuers, including those from China, are racing against time searching for signs of life among the wreckage in quake-stricken regions, as the essential 72-hour window has closed, but sanctions by the United States on Syria have obstructed coordinated efforts to save lives in the country, triggering worldwide criticism.

CLIMBING CASUALTIES
According to the latest statistics, the death toll from the devastating earthquakes reached 14,014 in TÃ¼rkiye and 3,556 in Syria and is expected to rise further, as the 72-hour window closed on Thursday morning.
More than 90 percent of earthquake survivors were rescued within the first three days, and the survival rate for those stranded without water and food drops drastically after the first 72 hours, said Gao Mengtan, a research fellow at the China Earthquake Administration.
He also warned that the optimal survival window may be much smaller than anticipated, given the low temperatures that swept through the disaster zones, which will increase the risk of fatal hypothermia.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country is facing ""one of the biggest disasters of the history of the Republic of TÃ¼rkiye.""
On Wednesday, he visited a ""tent city"" in hard-hit Kahramanmaras where thousands of survivors were living and admitted that there were some problems in the first-day response to the deadly earthquakes.
Meanwhile, Turkish volunteers flocked to the quake-hit zone to help the victims. Terminals were crowded with volunteers willing to lend a hand. Roads leading to the affected areas were clogged with vehicles transporting supplies or offering assistance.
Kerem Okyay, a Turkish volunteer, drove 200 km to help the victims in Elbistan, the epicenter of a 7.6 magnitude quake.
""We formed a team of volunteers with some friends as soon as we heard the news and came here immediately,"" said Okyay, adding they have helped save two survivors from under the ruins since their arrival on Monday.
""We were focusing on areas where we could hear people,"" he said.
In Syria, most of the quake-hit cities are still waiting for international aid, especially excavation equipment and medical supplies. Rescuers in Aleppo, northern Syria, have to dig through the rubble with their bare hands due to lack of rescue equipment.
UN Secretary-General spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Wednesday that the road leading to the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing from TÃ¼rkiye to northern Syria was damaged, and aid delivery to the rebel-held northwest was temporarily disrupted.

INTERNATIONAL AID POURS IN
International search and rescue teams, including an 82-member Chinese rescue team that arrived in TÃ¼rkiye on Wednesday, rushed to the quake-impacted zone to assist in rescue efforts.
The Chinese team arrived in the city of Adana in southern TÃ¼rkiye in the wee hours of Wednesday with around 20 tons of relief materials and equipment.
A Chinese civil rescue team and members of the Blue Sky Rescue (BSR) team, with rich experience in international rescue, also reached TÃ¼rkiye, bringing rescue dogs, equipment, and other necessary resources to support their work.
""We will try our best to search for and rescue survivors,"" said Zhang Yupu, a BSR member from east China's Jiangsu Province, who had participated in the Wenchuan earthquake relief in 2008.
Chinese companies are also lending a helping hand. The local branch of Chinese machinery giant Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group has deployed dozens of excavators and loaders as well as relief materials such as blankets and hygiene products to the earthquake-ravaged region.
Countries across the world also sent help. Russia has sent a second rescue team with medical specialists and rescuers to TÃ¼rkiye, according to the country's emergencies ministry Wednesday.
More than 100 Russian rescuers have already arrived in TÃ¼rkiye, and most are conducting search and rescue operations in the Kahramanmaras Province, which was the most affected by the earthquake.
Tunisia has dispatched three aircraft carrying rescuers and emergency aid, including food, medication and clothing, to the two quake-stricken countries.
Saudi Arabia launched a donation campaign on Wednesday to help the victims in Syria and TÃ¼rkiye. A total of 25 million Saudi Riyals (6.7 million U.S. dollars) has been collected so far, according to local press.
Armenia has sent 27 rescuers to the quake-hit regions of TÃ¼rkiye and 29 to Syria to assist in the search-and-rescue operations, its Internal Affairs Ministry said Wednesday.
Jordan, Sudan and Lebanon also announced plans to send rescue teams or aid to quake-impacted areas in Syria and TÃ¼rkiye.

OUTCRY FOR LIFTING U.S. SANCTIONS
In Syria, where the economic situation is even worse than TÃ¼rkiye, people are railing against the United States for retaining economic sanctions when Syria desperately needs help from the international community.
""These sanctions 'punished' us, but we didn't do anything. Shame on them ... They must remove these sanctions,"" Aisha al-Hilu, a school teacher in Syria's northern city of Aleppo said.
She told Xinhua that she and her family fled the house without taking any belongings and are in desperate need of food and clothing in the freezing weather.
Aleppo is among the cities hardest hit by Monday's megaquakes. The media office at the Aleppo governorate headquarters told Xinhua on Tuesday that the quakes killed at least 364 people, injured 702 others and toppled 52 buildings in the city.
The city is also one of the most devastated by Syria's civil war. The decade-long war and Western sanctions have damaged infrastructure and impoverished millions in northern Syria, making locals more vulnerable to natural disasters.
The Syrian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that U.S. sanctions are impeding rescue efforts and humanitarian assistance in Syria. As rescue equipment is banned in the country by the United States, Syrians are removing the wreckage with their bare hands and the simplest tools, the ministry said, adding that Syrians are also banned from essential medicines and medical equipment.
Quake-affected Syrians are also facing a severe shortage of fuel and gas to keep warm as the winter blizzard keeps battering the disaster zone and made things there even worse.

Countries, including China, and the public are urging the United States to lift its sanctions and blockade on the Arab country to allow much-needed aid to reach the disaster zone as soon as possible.
In an interview with the semi-official Mehr news agency, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani called on countries to pressure the United States into lifting the sanctions on Syria and the siege of the country to enable the delivery of international aid.
""The people of northern Syria are really suffering. Sanctions are stifling international relief and medical supplies. Thousands of deaths in Syria are preventible; earthquake relief should pause sanctions,"" tweeted Khaled Beydoun, associate professor of law at U.S.-based Wayne State University.
""Western countries don't need to send anything. Just remove lethal sanctions on Syria,"" tweeted Sharmine Narwani, a commentator and analyst of Middle East geopolitics and former senior associate at St. Antony's College, Oxford University.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Wednesday demanded an immediate lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria as the tremor-stricken country is facing a serious humanitarian crisis.
""Even today, U.S. troops still occupy Syria's principal oil fields, plunder more than 80 percent of the country's oil production, and have smuggled and burned Syria's grain stock, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis there,"" said Mao Ning, spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
""In the wake of the devastating earthquakes, the United States should let go of its geopolitical obsession, immediately lift unilateral sanctions on Syria and open the door for humanitarian aid,"" Mao added.

U.S. gunman killing 23 at El Paso Walmart pleads guilty to 90 charges,"HOUSTON, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- The gunman who killed 23 people including eight Mexicans in 2019 at a Walmart mall in the largely Latino border city of El Paso in the U.S. state of Texas pleaded guilty on Wednesday to 90 charges, including 23 counts of hate crimes resulting in death.
His plea comes three years, six months and five days after the mass shooting took place on Aug. 3, 2019 as the deadliest attack targeting Hispanics in U.S. history.
Patrick Crusius, then 21 years old, also admitted guilty to 23 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder in a crime of violence, 22 counts of hate crime in an attempt to kill, and 22 counts of use of a firearm during a crime of violence.
""Today's guilty plea marks one more step towards justice for the El Paso community; however, we must remember that the survivors and victims' families will be on a lifelong journey of healing because of this defendant's actions,"" Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Christopher Wray said in a statement.
The shooter showed no emotion in court, and nodded his head affirmatively as federal prosecutor Ian Martinez Hanna described how the killing took place, the El Paso Times reported.
Hanna said that Crusius admitted to being a white supremacist and committed the mass shooting in an effort to dissuade Mexicans and other Hispanics from coming to the United States.
""This attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas,"" Crusius wrote in a manifesto he is believed to have posted online about 20 minutes before the shooting. He had bought a semi-automatic rifle and 1,000 rounds of hollow-point ammunition online weeks ago and drove 11 hours to El Paso from his hometown Allen in northern Texas with the sole intent of killing immigrants, the indictment says.
Prosecutors recommended that he receive 90 consecutive life sentences. The judge will consider sentencing in June.
""White nationalist-fueled violence has no place in our society today,"" U.S. Justice Department's Civil Rights Division Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement. ""By pleading guilty, the defendant has admitted that he murdered innocent people based on their national origin and targeted Hispanics.""
The U.S. Justice Department announced last month that it would not seek the death penalty in federal charges. As a result, the maximum federal sentence the white male from Texas faces is life in prison.
Crusius also faces state charges for the mass shooting. Texas prosecutors have said they plan to seek the death penalty but a trial has not been scheduled yet.
A database of mass killings in the United States since 2006 compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University shows that the number of deadly mass shootings linked to hate crimes has increased in recent years across the United States, AP reported.

Introduction
The challenge arisen from the use of drugs is an international one; it is most acute in the United States. Twelve percent of global drug users come from the country, three times the proportion of the U.S. population to that of the world. Based on facts and statistics, this report examines the gravity, causes and economic and social costs of drug abuse in the United States.
I. Drug Abuse: A Social Malaise in the United States
â The U.S. National Center for Drug Abuse Statistics (NCDAS) lists eight categories of drugs most commonly used in the country: alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, fentanyl, opioids (mainly referring to psychotropic substances under control), prescription stimulants, methamphetamine and heroin. Forty-six percent of U.S. drug users report having experience using cannabis and prescription stimulants, 36 percent opioids and methamphetamine, 31 percent prescription stimulants, 15 percent heroin and 10 percent cocaine.
â In 2021, findings by NCDAS show about 19.4 percent of Americans have used illegal substances at least once. Out of the 280 million aged 12 and older, 31.9 million are drug users, with 11.7 percent on illegal substances and 19.4 percent either having consumed illicit drugs or misused prescription drugs in 2020. If alcohol and tobacco users are included, the number of people in the United States who are abusing substances totals 165 million.
â During the past 12 months, 48.2 million Americans over the age of 18 consumed cannabis at least once. Between 2018 and 2019, use of the substance increased by 15.9 percent. Though outlawed by the federal authorities, cannabis is legal in 15 states for recreational use. The cannabis industry in the country surged despite the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. When many businesses closed in March 2020 amid the pandemic, cannabis pharmacies in the eight states that legalized the substance were able to maintain their ""essential businesses"" because sales were allowed to continue during the period of mass home quarantine. As a result, legal cannabis sales in the United States hit a record 17.5 billion U.S. dollars in 2020, a 46 percent jump from that of 2019, according to BDSA, a platform providing cannabis sales data.
â During the past 12 months, 10.1 million Americans have consumed opium at least once. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), opioid is the primary driver of the spike in drug-related deaths. Between April 2020 and April 2021, 75,000 Americans died from opium overuse -- more than 75 percent of the total deaths from drug overdose and a 50 percent rise year on year.
â Each year, 95,000 people in the United States die from alcohol abuse. During the COVID-19 pandemic, over 60 percent of Americans increased their consumption of alcohol. According to the latest data, 25.8 percent of those aged 18 and older reported binge drinking in the past month, and on any given day 261 Americans would die from excessive drinking, 80 percent of whom are adults over the age of 35.
â Adolescents experience the fastest rise in drug overdose deaths. In this group, the 18 to 25-year-olds are the heaviest drug users, with 39 percent of them using drugs. For the 26 to 29-year-olds, it is 34 percent. Seventy percent of drug users try illicit drugs before the age of 13, and drug users as a population group is becoming younger. The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) reports that between January 2021 and June 2021, about 1,150 youngsters aged 14 to 18 died from drug overdose, a 20 percent increase from that of 2020 and more than doubling the number in 2019. In addition, 47 percent of adolescents start consuming illicit drugs upon graduation from high school.
II. Enormous Social Cost of Drug Abuse in the United States
â Drug overdose exacts a high death toll on the U.S. population, greatly eroding the base of labor force and weighing on life expectancy. According to a report on the American journal Science, American death toll of drug overdose has increased exponentially over the past 38 years -- up 9 percent almost every year and doubling about every eight years. A record high of 72,000 deaths was registered in 2017. The report also shows drug abuse plagues almost all states in the United States, with only a few exceptions, i.e. South Dakota, Nebraska and Iowa. In the past decade, drug abuse deaths in the country have risen significantly; the numbers more than tripled in Delaware and New Hampshire. According to the CDC, in the year following the outbreak of the pandemic (from April 2020 to April 2021), more than 100,000 people in the United States died from drug overdose, eight times that of shooting incidents, and nearly tripling the number of deaths in traffic accidents. Between 1999 and 2017, there were more than 700,000 cumulative deaths from drug overdose in the United States. Drug overdose in the country has claimed more lives than AIDS, traffic accidents and shootings, and 70 percent of the deaths are men between the age of 25 and 54.
â Drug abuse engenders frequent social problems. The damage to cranial nerves caused by drug taking may aggravate anxiety and cognitive disorder, induce some mental illnesses, and cause emotion dysregulation, thus leading to problems like family discord, violent crimes, and psychological trauma in children. In addition, people caught using illegal drugs may be punished by being separated from their family and deprived of job opportunities, welfare assistance, public housing and voting rights. As a result, discrimination against drug users continues, and stigmatization will further intensify inter-generational poverty and racial discrimination. This forms a vicious cycle, which is detrimental to American society and becomes an ""American disease"" that cannot be fixed easily. As the protracted COVID-19 pandemic and growing inflation and unemployment exacerbate anxiety and the sense of isolation among people in American society, drug abuse has become increasingly severe, and the number of people addicted to drugs has soared.
â Drug control incurs tremendous social cost. Such cost is entailed in crime fighting, health care, productivity loss, drug education and the prevention and treatment of other social problems. Among them, fighting drug-related crimes and health care cost the most. Since 1971, the United States has spent one trillion U.S. dollars combating drug-related crimes, according to a study by the University of Pennsylvania. In 2017, the cost of drug control in the United States exceeded 270 billion U.S. dollars.
III. Multiple Causes of Drug Abuse in the United States
For years, the U.S. federal and state governments have vowed to vigorously tackle the drug problem, but have in fact failed to take substantive measures due to lobbying by various interest groups. Drug abuse in the United States is a reflection of deep-rooted social problems, and the result of an interplay of economic interests, lobbying, and social and cultural factors.
â As the U.S. economy expanded after World War II, the rapid growth in national wealth created an unprecedentedly prosperous consumer market, including an active drug trade. By the 1960s, the nationwide hippie movement and the hippie culture it generated were ubiquitous in the United States, a part of which was ""drug culture."" Under the influence of ""drug culture,"" drugs such as cannabis and heroin quickly became popular among young people. The hippie movement brought drugs to the public, and its promoters claimed that cannabis was harmless and not a narcotic drug. Apart from that, they pushed for the social acceptance of cannabis abuse on the grounds of human rights and liberty, and called for its legalization. After the late 1970s, as the public witnessed the tremendous harm that drug abuse caused to society, families and individuals, there was a convergence in American people's perception of drugs and drug control. By the mid-1980s, calls for drug legalization waned, but there was no substantive improvement in the drug problem in the United States. Since the 1990s, calls for drug legalization have risen again in the country.
â The U.S. government has pushed for the legalization of cannabis and other drugs out of economic considerations. Legalizing cannabis allows the government to generate significant tax revenues from the legal drug market, and in return, the distribution of such revenues becomes an important driver of drug legalization. The U.S. government has justified drug legalization to cover the fact that it would do anything for economic gains.
â In 2014, cannabis was legalized in Colorado. Since then, the cumulative sales of cannabis have exceeded one billion U.S. dollars. However, the number of deaths from various kinds of drug abuse in the state has reached record highs. According to The New York Times, American parents said it got much easier for teens to obtain cannabis after its legalization in Colorado, potentially seriously endangering their brain development. Some experts said in interviews that they had treated a number of patients with symptoms related to drug addiction including severe vomiting due to cannabis use, including children who intentionally or accidentally consumed cannabis. The legalization of cannabis has further boosted the black market, which in turn puts great pressure on the judicial system and threatens social security. A large number of criminal organizations grow cannabis in Colorado and then smuggle it into other states where it is illegal, making the cannabis trade more active and law enforcement more difficult.
â Knowing the serious social problems brought by the legalization of cannabis, the U.S. government has not responded by strengthening cannabis control, but instead further promoted drug legalization. Between its people's lives and health and economic interests, the U.S. government has chosen the latter, which is an important factor in the sustained push for drug legalization in the country. According to the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, an American think tank, one could hardly see in the National Drug Control Strategy issued by the U.S. government the important roles the government is supposed to play in fighting one of the biggest public health challenges. Instead, it has sat idle as drug and substance abuse worsens.
â Interest groups in America keep fanning the flame of the drug problem. In order to maintain their profits, large pharmaceutical enterprises in the United States throw a large amount of money into sponsoring experts and associations to peddle the narrative that ""opioids are harmless."" What they want is to push for drug legalization and prod pharmacies into promoting drug sales and doctors into indiscriminate prescription of drugs. As a result, some patients have unknowingly developed drug addiction that they could not get rid of. After analyzing disclosed data from the U.S. Senate, the OpenSecrets website found that the marijuana and cannabis industry, which involved more than 20 businesses, spent as much as 4.28 million U.S. dollars on lobbying in 2021 alone. In addition, Amazon paid 14.5 million U.S. dollars between April and December in 2021 for funding lobbying activities, including for the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2021 (MORE Act) which supported the legalization of cannabis. For the same purpose, the American Civil Liberties Union spent 920,000 U.S. dollars on lobbying between July and December in 2021. British American Tobacco and the Altria Group spent nearly 2.1 million and 6.6 million U.S. dollars respectively in 2021 on lobbying for the MORE Act. The House of Representatives actively considered bills that promote the legalization of marijuana and cannabis. ""We don't need to convince people to believe in cannabis. We need to convince them to buy legally,"" said Cory Rothschild, vice president of a U.S. company in the cannabis industry.
â The drug culture influences America's drug policies. The U.S. drug culture has been shaped by the country's development history and directly affected the adjustment and evolution of America's drug policies. Due to pressure from both work and life, many people in the United States choose to take drugs for relief or leisure. Against this backdrop, in order to prevent people from using medical treatment as a pretext for drug abuse, U.S. federal law stipulates that one must present prescription by a doctor when purchasing certain drugs. However, this policy has big loopholes in terms of supervision, and drug abuse is prevalent in the United States. Pharmacies could still sell psychotropic drugs at will. As hospital reimbursement is directly linked to patient satisfaction, many doctors are forced to prescribe psychotropic drugs.
â The COVID-19 pandemic has made long-existing social problems even worse in the United States, and the pressure caused by such problems as gun violence, racism, social injustice and huge wealth gap is increasingly felt by young people. The various difficulties faced by young Americans are a reflection of America's persistent social illness. On the one hand, the widening gap between the rich and poor in the United States gives young Americans more doubts about the ""American Dream"" as they could hardly see room for upward mobility. On the other hand, young people no longer feel proud of America due to intensifying social inequality, racial conflicts and other problems. A Gallup poll showed that Americans' pride in the United States hit a record low in 2020. Only 36 percent of the respondents aged 18 to 24 said they were proud to be American, while 35 percent did not express pride in being American. In December 2021, the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University published the findings of its survey, which showed that 52 percent of the respondents believed American democracy was ""in trouble"" or ""failing""; only 7 percent of young Americans viewed the United States as a ""healthy democracy""; 51 percent of the young respondents had ""felt down, depressed and hopeless"" at least a few times in the past two weeks; 25 percent of the respondents had thoughts of self-harm; and 25 percent of them believed the cause of their mental health problems was economic concerns. As young people's confidence in the United States drops dramatically and the pressure they face keeps growing, more and more of them turn to drugs to relieve their stress.
â The drug problem is a manifestation of America's failure in social governance. According to Howard Koh, former Assistant Secretary for Health for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, drug and substance abuse in the United States is one of the most devastating public health disasters. Apart from causing heavy burdens on the public health system, it could make millions of people lose their homes or jobs, become truant or face family breakdown. The COVID-19 pandemic masked this crisis, but in the meantime also amplified it. The crisis showcases the U.S. government's failed regulation across multiple systems, and it is imperative to make prompt, unified and comprehensive response.
Conclusion
The drug problem of America is a long-standing and deep-rooted disease that is yet to be cured. The U.S. government has not done enough to raise public awareness of the harm of narcotic drugs; the measures it took to reduce drug demand are ineffective; and its drug control actions produce poor results. The United States should face its own problem squarely, take actions to deal with the domestic issue of prevalent drug abuse, and protect the American people's right to life and health, instead of shying away from the problem.
The fight against drugs requires, first and foremost, one's own efforts. At the same time, it also needs cooperation among all countries. The United States should stop making unwarranted accusations against China and undermining China-U.S. counter-narcotics cooperation. Even less should it mislead the public and shift its responsibility for ineffective response to drug abuse at home onto others.

"Study shows Asians in U.S. California more fearful of becoming gun violence, hate crime victims","

Two-thirds of Asians, and a similar percentage of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders, said they were ""very worried"" or ""somewhat worried"" about being a victim of gun violence, significantly higher than the 43 percent average of Californians of all races, according to the report.
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- Asian residents in the U.S. state of California were much more worried about becoming victims of gun violence and hate crimes compared to other racial and ethnic groups, a report by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research and AAPI Data said.
Two-thirds of Asians, and a similar percentage of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders, said they were ""very worried"" or ""somewhat worried"" about being a victim of gun violence, significantly higher than the 43 percent average of Californians of all races, according to the report released on Tuesday.
By comparison, 49 percent of Hispanic respondents, 45 percent of Black respondents, and 30 percent of white respondents said they were ""very worried"" or ""somewhat worried"" about becoming victims of gun violence, the report found.
The report cited results from the 2021 California Health Interview Survey, an annual UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) survey that interviewed more than 20,000 California households.
Within the Asians, people of Korean origin reported the highest level of fear of gun violence, with 70 percent saying they were very worried or somewhat worried about it. This was followed by 66 percent of people of Filipino and Chinese origin, and 62 percent of people of Vietnamese origin, according to the report.
Several factors likely contributed to Asians' higher level of fear of gun violence victimization, including reports of hate crimes and hate incidents against Asian residents during the pandemic, said Karthick Ramakrishnan, founder of AAPI Data and a professor of public policy at UC Riverside.
One in four Asian Americans in California has ever experienced a hate crime or hate incident, with Southeast Asians reporting the highest levels of hate experiences at a rate of 44 percent, according to the report.

Attitudes toward reporting hate crimes to law enforcement agencies varied among Asian groups. Only one third of Asian Americans expressed being ""very comfortable"" reporting hate crimes to law enforcement.
Confidence in the criminal legal system varied much more across factors such as nativity and English proficiency. Only 36 percent of U.S.-born Asian Americans agreed that justice would be served, statistically significantly lower than that of both naturalized Asian American citizens and Asian American non-citizens, the report showed.
The mass shootings in schools, movie theaters, and other public settings over the last several years may have also contributed to the heightened sense of fear, Ramakrishnan said.
Previous research done by AAPI Data showed that Asian Americans tended to be the strongest supporters of gun control, he added.
Ramakrishnan surmised that if the same survey were conducted today, an even higher proportion of Asians would report being worried about gun violence after the two recent mass shootings in the AAPI (Asian American Pacific Islander) community in Half Moon Bay and Monterey Park.
""Gun control is an Asian American issue, it has not gotten the recognition it deserves... Asian Americans need to be part of that conversation. It also means gun control advocacy organizations need to pay attention and invest in Asian American communities,"" Ramakrishnan was quoted as saying in a report by the San Francisco Chronicle.

Quake survivors still being pulled out in 4th-day rescues in TÃ¼rkiye,"ISTANBUL, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- Scenes of people being rescued from under rubble flooded social media and news channels on Thursday as search and rescue efforts enter their fourth day following catastrophic earthquakes in southern TÃ¼rkiye.
Rescue teams from across TÃ¼rkiye and around the world are still able to find survivors in the rubble of toppled buildings and pulled them out against all odds.
In Antalya, a city in southern Hatay Province, siblings 12-year-old Mahir, 8-year-old Hilal and 1-year-old Rami were recovered to safety after being buried under a collapsed building for 80 hours.
Video provided by Antalya municipality shows local firefighters pulling them out and loading them onto a stretcher.
Earlier that day, members of the National Medical Rescue Unit from the southeastern province of Hakkari had saved a seven-month-old baby who had been buried for 66 hours in Hatay.
Hatay, a province bordering Syria, was hit particularly hard by Monday's earthquakes, and many people are still waiting to be saved.
Istanbul municipality's search and rescue personnel have extracted 424 survivors there so far, according to a tweet shared by Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu on Thursday.
Meanwhile, in the worst-hit Kahramanmaras Province, the epicenter of the two deadly earthquakes that struck TÃ¼rkiye and Syria on Monday, firefighters from the capital of Ankara have saved over 200 people, according to Ankara Mayor Mansur Yavas.
Yavas also shared a video of Ankara firefighters saving a 25-year-old named Abdullah after 70 hours under rubble.
On the scene were not just Turkish search and rescue teams -- dozens of countries have sent rescuers to the affected areas. Garo Paylan, a member of parliament, shared photographs of a search and rescue team from Armenia working in the southeastern province of Adiyaman.
Meanwhile, similar videos of teams from Hungary, Spain, Greece, and Israel saving children were also being circulated.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday that the death toll from earthquakes in the country has reached 16,546 and over 66,000 were injured.

KHARTOUM, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday expressed Russia's support for Sudan's efforts to resolve the country's political crisis without foreign dictations.
""We support Sudan's efforts to achieve stability. We support the national dialogue among the Sudanese away from foreign dictations,"" Lavrov told a joint press conference with Sudanese Acting Foreign Minister Ali Al-Sadiq at the airport of Sudan's capital Khartoum.
""We support Sudan's endeavor to lift the sanctions imposed on it and we will work to support each other regarding the decisions of the United Nations,"" he added.

He added that any ""just observer"" can realize the extent to which the U.S. and some Western countries are ""stubbornly"" sticking to their ""hegemonic"" positions and refraining from understanding and accepting the realities of Iran as an independent and free country.
Turning to the talks on the revival of the 2015 nuclear deal, Raisi said that Iran has, since months ago, expressed its readiness to finalize the negotiations and achieving a ""good and fair agreement"" and has shown its goodwill to this end, despite the Western sides' failure to honor their commitments.
Iran signed the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), with world powers in July 2015, agreeing to put some curbs on its nuclear program in return for the removal of the sanctions on the country. The U.S., however, pulled out of the deal in May 2018 and reimposed its unilateral sanctions on Iran, prompting the latter to reduce some of its nuclear commitments under the deal.
The talks on the JCPOA's revival began in April 2021 in Vienna, Austria. No breakthrough has been achieved after the latest round of talks held in August 2022.

The impact of gun violence extends far beyond just those who are injured or killed.
NEW YORK, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States is a nation of gun violence survivors, with more people dying from gun violence in the country by early February this year than during an entire calendar year in other high-income countries, according to an Annenberg Media report this week.
In 2022, for the third straight year, the United States recorded over 600 mass shootings in each of which at least four people were killed or injured, according to the Gun Violence Archive.
""The number continues to rise, as the recent tragedy in Monterey Park stands as one of the deadliest mass shootings in California's history,"" said the report.
""The impact of gun violence extends far beyond just those who are injured or killed. Take a glimpse of the lives of the families, communities, and individuals who bear the lasting scars of gun violence,"" it noted.
""There were bodies and blood everywhere around me. It was bloody, too graphic to look at,"" Niu Yi, a survivor of the deadly shooting in late January that claimed the lives of 11 in a Monterey Park ballroom, California, was quoted as saying. ""I have a shadow in my heart.""

"Spanish writer tells West to understand, not to demonize China","MADRID, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- The Western world should try to understand China better rather than demonize it, Spanish writer Julio Ceballos said on Wednesday in an exclusive interview with Xinhua following the presentation here of his new book on China ""Watching the rice grow.""
The book, whose original Spanish title is ""Observando el arroz crecer,"" contains 88 short stories or articles that aim to inform readers about Chinese culture, and help them understand the country and the way its people think.
Ceballos is an expert in internationalization, market strategy and negotiation, who lived and worked in China for 17 years. He said that ""the truth is that today China knows the West much better than we know China.""
The writer believes ""there is a need for more Western people with knowledge of Chinese reality. There are more bridges to cross from one shore to the other. We need more specialists who know this country (China) on the ground, and more ties between Western and Chinese citizens to help to eliminate barriers and knock down unfounded stereotypes.""
He insisted that ""everyone should know China; but most people in the Western world do not know it."" In his opinion, there is a ""very simple"" reason why people need this understanding: ""China is already the largest exporter in the world.""
The West, he said, is ""still trapped in echo chambers that only reinforce the preconceived ideas (and not always correct) that we have of almost everything Chinese."" In order to change these conceptions, he advised people to ""get on a plane, visit China, see, smell, hear, taste and feel what is happening.""
""It is a good first step, at street level and first-hand, to form an opinion of flesh and blood and not to simply demonize China,"" he insisted.

Measuring excess mortality allows us a partial view of the collateral damage caused by the pandemic.
NEW YORK, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- A total of 4,511 U.S. physicians died during the early phase of COVID-19 -- 622 more deaths than would have occurred had the pandemic not happened, according to a research letter published in JAMA (The Journal of the American Medical Association) Internal Medicine.
Excess physician deaths peaked at 70 in December 2020 among all active physicians, followed by a rapid drop in 2021 when safe and effective vaccines became available, said a report published on the American Medical Association (AMA) website this week, citing the study ""Excess Mortality Among Physicians During The COVID-19 Pandemic.""
No excess deaths among physicians occurred after April 2021, which coincided with the widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines, meaning that nearly 50 U.S. doctors more than expected died each month during this phase of the pandemic.
""Measuring excess mortality allows us a partial view of the collateral damage caused by the pandemic,"" Lindsey Carlasare, research and policy manager for the AMA and an author on the research letter, was quoted as saying.
For the study, researchers from Stanford University School of Medicine and the University of Southern California, Los Angeles used data from the AMA Masterfile and the corresponding Deceased Physician File to calculate excess deaths from March 2020 through December 2021 among U.S. physicians 45-84 years old.

U.S. federal official warns of 191 bln USD in COVID-19 unemployment aid misspent: media,"NEW YORK, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government may have misspent roughly 191 billion U.S. dollars in pandemic unemployment benefits, a top federal watchdog told Congress on Wednesday, as Washington continues to uncover the vast and still-growing extent of the waste, fraud and abuse targeting coronavirus aid.
""The new estimate -- computed by Larry D. Turner, the inspector general of the Labor Department -- galvanized House Republicans as they intensified their scrutiny of the roughly 5 trillion dollars in emergency funds approved since the start of the crisis,"" reported The Washington Post.
Opening the inquiry, Smith described the problems plaguing unemployment insurance as the ""greatest theft of taxpayer dollars in American history.""
The money helped rescue the economy from the worst crisis since the Great Depression, but ""it also invited an unprecedented wave of theft and abuse, as criminals seized on the government's generosity -- and its race to disburse aid -- to bilk state and federal agencies for massive sums,"" said the report.
Top watchdogs told the House Ways and Means Committee that they still cannot compute the total amount of federal COVID aid subject to fraud and abuse, but Turner's testimony noted that the country's misspending on unemployment benefits, in particular, may be far greater than previously known, it added.

The overlap between influenza, RSV and a cold-weather surge in coronavirus infections led to concerns of a so-called ""tripledemic.""
According to the survey, nearly half of respondents said the news of those three viruses spreading made them more likely to wear masks or take other precautions to avoid getting sick, such as wearing a mask in public or avoiding large gatherings.
The flu affected 27 percent of households over the past month or so, with 15 percent saying someone in their homes got sick with COVID-19. RSV infected someone in about 10 percent of homes, the survey found.

The COVID-19 pandemic has re-illuminated how racism and social and structural inequities in this country negatively influence health outcomes among people of color.
NEW YORK, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- During the early stages of the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States, uptake of COVID-19 vaccines was higher among White, non-Hispanic persons as compared with people of color, reported Nature on Wednesday.
""These early racial and ethnic disparities in vaccination rates led many news stories, journal articles and other reports to perpetuate a narrative that disparities in the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines among people of color were largely driven by vaccine hesitancy, while neglecting to focus on health inequities and other factors as drivers of disparities in vaccine intentions and uptake,"" said the report.
The COVID-19 pandemic has re-illuminated how racism and social and structural inequities in this country negatively influence health outcomes among people of color, laid bare by their disproportionate burden of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths, according to the report.
Use of the term vaccine hesitancy in the context of COVID-19 vaccines might be perceived as placing responsibility for vaccination status on the individual, leaving historical and current social and structural inequities that affect vaccine confidence and vaccination rates unexamined and unaddressed, it said.
""The failure of the media and scientific scholars to contextualize how inequities affect vaccine intentions and uptake among people of color during a critical period when there was a defined goal for adult COVID-19 vaccination in the USA reveals missed opportunities to change the narrative from hesitancy and refusal toward racism and inequities that affect vaccine intentions and uptake,"" it added.

ANKARA, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- People in Trkiye are racing against the clock to search for more survivors in the deadly earthquakes, while the chances are diminishing as the relief effort enters its fourth day.
The death toll from Monday's devastating earthquake in Trkiye has risen to 14,014, with other 63,794 injured so far, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday.
STATE OF EMERGENCY
A state of emergency decision for 10 quake-affected provinces will take effect after voted today at the parliament as of Thursday afternoon, Erdogan told reporters when visiting the southern Gaziantep province where he inspected the emergency response.
The government will intervene in the incidents of looting in quake zones with the authority provided by a state of emergency, the Turkish president said.
""In some places, unfortunately, there is looting in the markets, and shopping malls. The state will intervene in these lootings under the state of emergency after obtaining the authority from the parliament,"" he said.
The government will immediately start work for new housing in the disaster region, while the containers are being provided for temporary accommodation at the moment, Erdogan explained.
Hundreds of rescued but unattended children are dispatched to the hospitals in Trkiye's big cities Istanbul and Ankara.
On Wednesday, Erdogan acknowledged the ""shortcomings"" in the government's initial response to the disaster but reassured that they had managed to handle the efforts to help the victims since the second day of the disaster.
HOLD ON TO HOPE
Nevertheless, although the golden 72 hours of rescue have passed, people are still doing their best to search and rescue in firm faith and hope under the cold weather.
Turkish rescue teams pulled out a 60-year-old woman named Meral Nakir from the rubble of an apartment in Malatya province 77 hours after Monday's quake, the state broadcaster TRT showed.
The injured woman was rescued from the rubble of a 6-storey building with the help of a trained dog ""Kopuk"" (Foam). The Golden Retriever served in the same wreck for two days and saved six people alive.

Jawad Abu Asali, a Syrian displaced from Hama, one of the quake-stricken areas, said they were closely following the situation in Syria through television, radio, and social media, and ""everything we hear or see is worrying,"" he said.
""We, as displaced persons, regret the siege imposed on our country by the state of aggression, America, which limits the delivery of aid to the stricken areas in dire need of support after this disaster,"" he said.

He called on all international bodies to support the rescue crews and the thousands of injured people.

HATAY, TÃ¼rkiye, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- At 1:30 a.m. local time (1030 GMT) on Thursday, Chinese and local rescue team members stood in line and smoothly transported a stretcher by hand. On the stretcher was a pregnant woman who had just been rescued from a collapsed house.
It was not until the pregnant woman was sent to the ambulance that the rescuers were slightly relieved. They patted their colleagues on the back, sharing joy and encouraging each other.
The woman was found by Turkish rescuers in the ruins of an eight-story building in Antakya, a city in Hatay Province, one of the country's worst-hit regions, at around 6:00 p.m. local time (1500 GMT) Wednesday, said Zhao Yang, deputy leader of the Chinese rescue team.
Zhao and his teammates rushed to the scene after local rescuers contacted them. Upon arrival, they assessed the situation and then made a rescue plan with their Turkish partners.
The Chinese team also gave professional advice and provided technical equipment during the rescue operation, Zhao told reporter.
The team landed at the Adana international airport on Wednesday and arrived in Antakya after an 8,000-km flight and hours of road trip. With no time to rest, they immediately joined the rescue operation.

Later on Thursday, two more survivors were plucked to safety from the ruins of collapsed buildings beyond the critical 72 hours for rescue by Chinese and Turkish rescue teams.
The first young woman was got out from the ruins of a seven-story building. She was covered with blankets provided by the rescue team, wearing neck guards and looking pale. The rescue team carefully carried her into an ambulance and sent her to hospital for treatment.
In the evening, another woman was found in a basement. After unremitting efforts, the rescue team carried her out. Rescuers covered her with a special thermal film, before carefully carrying her to an ambulance.
International rescuers are racing against time to search for signs of life in quake-hit regions. Several search and rescue teams from China have arrived with rescue dogs, rescue equipment and other relief supplies to assist in the efforts.

"EU leaders fail to agree on Ukraine, migration policy at extraordinary summit","

Although there was some agreement on continued European support to Ukraine in its conflict with Russia, opinions diverged on immigration policy and on specifics related to Ukraine's candidacy for European Union (EU) membership.
ROME, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- An extraordinary European Council summit convened in Brussels to discuss Ukraine, economic policy and migration wrapped up on Friday with unresolved differences among leaders over key issues.
Although there was some agreement on continued European support to Ukraine in its conflict with Russia, opinions diverged on immigration policy and on specifics related to Ukraine's candidacy for European Union (EU) membership.
During a visit by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to the two-day summit, he called for more economic and military aid for his country. Heads of state and government agreed to do whatever it takes to support Ukraine, but many of the details of what this will mean still need to be hammered out.
Leaders also failed to agree on a timetable for Ukraine's accession to the EU as Zelensky had hoped.

Moreover, even the terms on Ukraine that have been agreed have caused some divisions.
Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Friday criticized France's President Emmanuel Macron for organizing a closed-door meeting that included Zelensky and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, but excluded leaders of other EU member states.
Meloni said that the ""inappropriate"" discussions between the Ukrainian leader, and the leaders of the EU's two largest economies ""threatened the unity"" of the 27-nation bloc in confronting the crisis in Ukraine. ""I think our strength in this fight is unity,"" Meloni said, after meeting privately with Zelensky on the sidelines of the summit.
Last year, Macron and Scholz worked closely with Mario Draghi, Meloni's predecessor.
Meanwhile, Bulgarian president Rumen Radev called for peace in Ukraine.

Speaking before Zelensky's arrival at the summit, Radev said that sending more military aid to the conflict was like ""putting out fire with gasoline."" He added that ""one year after the start of"" this conflict, it was now time to move the focus onto measures to stop it, and ""diplomatic efforts in search of a peaceful solution.""
Regarding migration, Meloni declared a victory as leaders agreed that they must take shared responsibility and share the cost of a widening migration crisis, a key issue for Italy.
""A new principle was established,"" Meloni said. ""It now says, in black and white, a sentence that it had never been possible to write down before: 'immigration is an EU problem and needs an EU response.'""

Nevertheless, certain specifics still need clarifying in terms of a united EU response, and it is not clear when these will be addressed.
Elsewhere, France and Germany pushed for a united response in combating the effects of the economic subsidy package in the United States, dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act. The two countries said the plan gave U.S. companies an unfair advantage over European rivals. However, although the issue was discussed in depth at the summit, there was no conclusion on a response.
The European Council is made up of heads of state or government from the 27 EU member states.

DAMASCUS, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- A plane carrying emergency medical supplies from China arrived Thursday in Syria to help the country in the aftermath of a deadly earthquake.
The plane, belonging to the Red Cross Society of China (RCSC), landed at the Damascus international airport Thursday evening.
The Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) received the shipment at the airport with Chinese Ambassador Shi Hongwei present.
Shi expressed confidence that Syria will overcome the catastrophic impact of the quake, saying that China stands with Syria in dealing with the disaster.
On Thursday evening, Syria's Health Minister Hassan al-Ghabbash said the death toll from the earthquake rose to 1,347 and the number of injured to 2,295.
The minister called on the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and other international organizations to provide assistance to Syria to deal with the disaster.
After strong earthquakes jolted TÃ¼rkiye and Syria on Monday, the RCSC has provided the Turkish Red Crescent and the Syrian Red Crescent with 200,000 U.S. dollars in cash respectively as emergency humanitarian assistance.
The RCSC said it will remain updated on the humanitarian needs in the disaster-stricken areas of the two countries and pledged to offer humanitarian aid to the best of its ability.

The first squad from Chinaâs Blue Sky Rescue (BSR) team was the first international assistance force to enter Malatya, TÃ¼rkiye, arriving at the camp there on Feb. 9 local time.
The squad was divided into seven groups, equipped with life detectors and other rescue facilities, and rushed to different work sites.
The dispatched team had kept close contact with the Turkish Embassy in China and TÃ¼rkiye's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) before leaving, according to He Qingrong, liaison officer of the international department of the BSR.
He said that they also learned that the volunteer forces there are composed of local Chinese, Turks who had studied in China and Chinese students from the Confucius Institute.
âBefore our first team arrived, a 30-member translation group had already been waiting at the airport for a day,â He added. With the help of local volunteers, we efficiently overcame any language difficulties.
âItâs the first time that we completely addressed problems caused by language. Once they are smoothly handled, all other issues will be much easier. As soon as we reached the rescue site, we got a full picture of what was going on here in just ten minutes,â He said.
The BSR team will continue the rescue work over the next dozen days, the liaison officer noted.
The second group of BSR team members is expected to depart on Feb. 11 (Beijing Time).

The temperature in Malatya city is still low, dropping to below zero degrees Celsius at midday, according to Zhang.
The roads at the damaged areas are frozen and slippery, and many buildings have collapsed in the disaster, he said.

""Rubble is everywhere. Pieces of rubble lie on top of each other and are covered with snow, which makes rescue work more difficult,"" he told People's Daily Online.
""Our top priority is to search for signs of life,"" Zhang said, adding that rescuers work in groups, with each group being responsible for a specific type of task. Zhang's group is responsible for communication between different sites for the supply of materials and the transfer of personnel.
""As soon as a sign of life is detected, we need to immediately send the appropriate machinery and rescue personnel to the spot where the survivor is, so as to ensure the rescue operation can be carried out smoothly,"" Zhang said.
Local overseas Chinese and warm-hearted volunteers have provided great support for the rescuers, according to Zhang, who revealed that they have made thoughtful preparations for work handover, and also prepared living supplies for them, including drinking water and bread.
""The transnational rescue operation is touching, heart-warming, and heart-shaking,"" Zhang said.

From China-bashing to China-hiding: How Western media excludes China from TÃ¼rkiye rescue efforts,"Western media frequently portrays China negatively, and they never cease to shock the world by descending to new lows, such as burying China's efforts to aid earthquake-ravaged TÃ¼rkiye.
Despite being one of many countries that have sent several governmental and civilian teams, and provided assistance supplies to TÃ¼rkiye and Syria in the aftermath of the earthquake, Western media has intentionally ignored China's contributions in their coverage.
Unwelcome details blanked out
On February 9, CNN released a photo report with multiple images of rescue workers from different countries. These photos were accompanied by captions that detailed the rescue crews' nationalities and provided specifics about the missions they undertook. Rescuers from countries including Japan, South Korea, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are depicted, but Chinese rescuers are noticeably absent.
There is no reason to criticize CNN for leaving out Chinese rescue workers from their report on the worldwide rescue squad, as it is reasonable to assume that the network could not include all countries in its coverage.
However, on the same day, CNN published a photo shot by Reuters showing a Chinese rescuer looking on as his colleagues searched amid the rubble. The words ""China Search and Rescue"" were barely legible in English but noticeable in Chinese on his jacket. Unlike his international colleagues, the Chinese man in the backdrop of this photo receives no mention in the caption.

The photo was published by CNN without any mention of the Chinese rescuers. (Photo taken from CNN's website)
When it comes to reporting on China, Western media tends to exaggerate and twist anything ""Chinese"" so that it can be used to criticize the country. Furthermore, crucial details that could help foreigners get a better understanding of the country are routinely covered up.
Over the past few days, western media outlets have produced countless pieces highlighting rescue operations from countries like the US in TÃ¼rkiye while ignoring the fact that US sanctions are the main reason international rescue personnel have encountered problems reaching Syria, another country that was affected severely by the earthquake. Some western media outlets have prioritized their political bias, excluding countries like China from their coverage rather than fostering global cooperation at this crucial moment.

China has been sending rescue workers and other supplies to TÃ¼rkiye since the earthquake struck the country. By Thursday, the Chinese government had dispatched 82 rescue experts to TÃ¼rkiye, while 12 non-governmental rescue teams, numbering 250 individuals in total, had also arrived in the country to aid with rescue efforts.
The Chinese government's expert rescue crew has pulled at least three people, including a pregnant woman, from the debris in just two days. China has announced it will provide 40 million yuan ($5.9 million) in emergency aid to TÃ¼rkiye and 30 million yuan to Syria.
Chinaâs Ministry of Commerce is preparing disaster relief materials urgently needed in TÃ¼rkiye and Syria and arranging transportation, said Shu Jueting, a ministry spokeswoman, at a news conference on Thursday. ""We will strive to transport the materials to the affected areas as soon as possible.""
Shu said the ministry is also accelerating the implementation of an ongoing food aid program to Syria. About 220 metric tons of wheat have been sent to the country and more than 3,000 tons of wheat and rice will be shipped very soon, she said.

NEW YORK, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- Although U.S. President Joe Biden tried to emphasize what his administration had done to tackle climate change, millions of U.S. people are displaced by natural disasters worsened by a changing climate.
A new Census Bureau report found that more than 3 million adults were forced to evacuate their homes in the past year because of hurricanes, floods and other events, said U.S. news website Politico on Monday.
It said that Biden and Congress certainly need to do a lot more if the nation is to accomplish its climate goals. ""For one, the country is not on a path to cut enough carbon to meet global reduction targets, and it remains unclear where the U.S. will get the mass supply of critical minerals -- or the vast expansion of electrical transmission capacity -- it needs for the energy transition.""
""Addressing these concerns ahead of the next presidential election could be an uphill battle for Biden. Opposition from the new GOP-controlled House means passing new climate laws is unlikely. And the conservative Supreme Court could further kneecap Biden's regulatory powers,"" said the report.

The Namibian military had confirmed that the sail drone, a sailboat-like uncrewed craft designed to gather data was found ""in the most remote regions of the ocean and the harshest conditions,"" local media Erongo 24/7 reported earlier this week.
""We are preparing a comprehensive media briefing in this regard,"" Namibia Defence Force spokesperson Petrus Shilumbu was quoted as saying, without sharing details.
According to state-owned daily The New Era, the sail drone was confiscated from two South African nationals, who were sent by its operator in the United States to recover it from the sea.
It has reportedly been transported under heavy military guard to Windhoek for further analysis.
Tiffany Miller, spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Namibia denied reports that his government was involved with or has interfered with the confiscated drone.
According to Miller, although the drone was made and operated by Saildrone, a private U.S. company, the University of Gothenburg, in Sweden contracted the drone for marine research purposes.

UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- The high level of threat posed by the Islamic State (IS), also known as Da'esh, underscored the need for multidimensional approaches beyond security-centered responses, the United Nations counter-terrorism chief said on Thursday.
""More complementarity is needed between security responses and preventive measures,"" UN Undersecretary-General Vladimir Voronkov told the Security Council during a briefing.
Presenting the latest report of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on the threat posed by Da'esh, Voronkov said that despite leadership losses and expenses that are diminishing its cash reserves, ""the threat posed by Da'esh to international peace and security remains high.""
The threat increased in and around conflict zones where the group and its affiliates are active, said Voronkov, adding that the level of terrorist activity besides attacks continues to be a concern to UN member states.
""For example, Da'esh continues to use the Internet and social media, video games and gaming adjacent platforms to extend the reach of its propaganda to radicalize and recruit new supporters,"" he said.
The multidimensional approaches to counter Da'esh threat must be gender-sensitive and firmly anchored in international law, including international human rights and international humanitarian law, as well as reflective of a broad range of views from various segments in societies affected by terrorism, Voronkov said.
Citing the increased threat from terrorism in conflict zones, Voronkov, who heads the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism, said further efforts are necessary to address and prevent these conflicts in the first place.
""While terrorists exploit conflict dynamics, peace efforts are too often undermined and further complicated by terrorism,"" he said. ""Better understanding the complex relationship between conflict and terrorism is a necessary step for devising more effective responses to these recurring challenges.""

"U.S. sanctions hugely erode purchasing power of Iranian middle, lower classes","TEHRAN, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- Although the United States claims that the Iranian people are not the target of its sanctions, the country's middle and lower classes are experiencing a huge erosion of purchasing power as a result of the unilateral coercive measures.
Mohsen Mohammadi, a sales manager of a real estate office, said because of the U.S. sanctions, it has become difficult for low- and middle-class people in Iran to rent a house, let alone purchase one.
Two years ago, it cost about 1.5 billion rials (3,488 U.S. dollars in the parallel market) to buy a decent housing unit with an area of almost 90 square meters. Now, that amount is hardly sufficient to pay the yearly rent of a 60-square meter one, he explained.
Lying behind the soaring prices is the sharp depreciation of the rial against other major currencies over the past years as a result of U.S. sanctions. In 2018, each dollar was sold at 32,000 rials in the Iranian market, while the greenback is now priced at around 430,000 rials.
In addition, as many of the construction materials in Iran are imported, they are susceptible to sanctions and fluctuations in the foreign currency market, Mohammadi said, adding the cost of construction has witnessed a fourfold increase in the past three years.
Iran's automobile market is also among the sectors hit hard by the sanctions, which have made it difficult for the country to import cars and auto spare parts.
Prior to the reimposition of the U.S. sanctions, a locally manufactured sedan model known as Pride, an economy car affordable by the lower class, was priced at about 300 million rials, but it is sold at about 2.88 billion rials at present.
The price increase has been even more noticeable with regard to foreign automobiles.
Against such unfavorable conditions, domestic automakers in Iran are gaining momentum and expanding in size in the past few years.
Iran's car production has seen a steady increase since March 2019, as the country produced 671,435 vehicles from March 2019 to March 2020, and 994,156 from March 20 to Dec. 22, 2022, according to a report by the semi-official Mehr news agency.
Former U.S. President Donald Trump pulled Washington out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and the world powers in May 2018, and reimposed unilateral sanctions on the country.
The sanctions, which have targeted Iran's main lifelines, namely oil exports and banking sectors, were reimposed as part of the U.S. ""maximum pressure"" campaign against Iran in an attempt to negotiate a new nuclear deal with the Iranian government.

TÃ¼rkiye-Armenia border gate reopens after 30 years for quake aid,"ANKARA, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- A border gate between TÃ¼rkiye and Armenia has been opened for the first time in 30 years for the passage of humanitarian assistance for victims of the devastating earthquakes hitting southern TÃ¼rkiye, the state-run Anadolu News Agency reported Saturday.
An Armenian delegation with five trucks of aid has entered TÃ¼rkiye through the Alican Border Gate in the eastern province of Igdir, the report said.
The Armenian aid delegation carrying 100 tonnes of food, medicine, and drinking water passed through the gate in the morning toward the southeastern province of Adiyaman, according to a tweet on Saturday by Serdar Kilic, TÃ¼rkiye's special representative for normalization talks with Armenia.
On Tuesday, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan offered condolences and support to the Turkish people in a phone conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Armenia has sent 27 rescuers to quake-hit TÃ¼rkiye to assist in the search-and-rescue operations, the country's internal affairs ministry said Wednesday.
The Alican Border Gate was last used in the 1988 earthquake in Armenia when the Turkish Red Crescent crossed the border gate to dispatch aid to disaster areas.
TÃ¼rkiye severed diplomatic relations and closed the border with Armenia in 1993 in support of Azerbaijan which was fighting a war with Armenia over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, before the two neighbors launched talks for the re-normalization of relations in 2022.
On Monday, two devastating earthquakes measuring 7.7- and 7.6-magnitude hit 10 provinces in southern TÃ¼rkiye, killing at least 21,848 so far and injuring over 80,000, according to the latest figures.

"TÃ¼rkiye-Syria quakes ""worst"" disaster of region in century, says UN as more aid needed","ANKARA, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- The devastating earthquakes that shook southern TÃ¼rkiye and northern Syria was the ""worst event"" to hit the region in a century, a senior official from the United Nations said on Saturday.
""What happened here on Monday, the epicenter of the earthquake, was the worst event in 100 years in this region,"" Martin Griffiths, UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, told reporters in the Turkish province of Kahramanmaras.
More than 100 countries have sent emergency response teams to TÃ¼rkiye, but ""we're going to need more than that,"" Griffiths said.
The UN would launch the appeal to raise money for agencies to come and help the people who've been affected, he added.
""We have a clear plan tomorrow (or) the day after to give an appeal for a three-month operation to help the people of TÃ¼rkiye with humanitarian assistance, and we will do some similar one for the people of Syria,"" he said.
As they are coming to the end of the rescue phase, the UN official expressed concern for the second phase of the disaster. ""The second phase of a natural disaster of this size is often a medical one, where we have huge worries here and in Syria, of the health problems which have been going on treated,"" he noted.
TÃ¼rkiye's response to the disaster was ""extraordinary,"" Griffiths added.
The death toll from Monday's devastating earthquakes climbed to 22,327 in TÃ¼rkiye, while another 80,278 injuries were reported in the country, Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca announced on Saturday night.
Search and rescue efforts in ten quake-hit 10 provinces of TÃ¼rkiye have now begun to turn to debris removal on the sixth day of the disaster. Rescue teams from across TÃ¼rkiye and around the world were still trying to find survivors in the rubble of toppled buildings and pulled them out against all odds. However, while the number of casualties is soaring, the number of injured pulled out of the rubble was so few on Saturday.
In a statement, the Turkish Medical Association warned about infectious diseases that may occur after the earthquake. Damage to infrastructure such as electricity, water, and sewerage increases the risk of water and food-borne diseases, the statement said.
Risks increase for acute respiratory infections such as influenza, and coronavirus, along with the possibility of contact-transmitted diseases such as scabies, lice, fungi, and diarrheal diseases, it added.
Chinese rescuers have successfully saved at least four survivors so far. An 82-member China Search and Rescue Team arrived in TÃ¼rkiye on Wednesday to join earthquake relief efforts in the country. Members of the Blue Sky Rescue Team and other Chinese civil relief squads were also in TÃ¼rkiye to join the international rescue work.
At least 160,000 people, including foreign teams, were on the field for search and rescue efforts, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday. All the state dormitories of universities will be reserved for earthquake victims, and university students will have distance learning until the summer, he noted.
Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu slammed Germany and Austria because their teams have suspended their efforts due to security threats, and criticized them for ""slandering"" TÃ¼rkiye.
""Austria's search and rescue team left the job with the claim of battering ... From the first day (of the quake), 416 incidents took place. In the six days before the earthquake, 586 events occurred,"" in the region, the Turkish minister explained.
""230 people have been detained so far, there are more than 20 arrests. Our friends take the security of the logistics warehouses, the security of the debris fields, the security of the tent sites,"" he said.
A border gate between TÃ¼rkiye and Armenia has been opened for the first time in decades for the passage of humanitarian assistance for earthquake victims, the state-run Anadolu News Agency reported Saturday.
The Alican Border Gate was last used in the 1988 earthquake in Armenia when the Turkish Red Crescent crossed the border gate to dispatch aid to disaster areas.

WHO chief visits quake-hit northern Syria with aid,"ALEPPO, Syria, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus visited the quake-hit Aleppo city in northern Syria on Saturday, raising hope for more emergency aid to reach Syria in the coming days.
The World Health Organization brought 35 tons of relief aid to Aleppo on Saturday as Ghebreyesus reached the city and visited some hospitalized people, shelters where displaced people are staying, and damaged areas.
His visit comes in the wake of the deadly earthquake that rocked Syria on Monday, killing 5,000 people in government and rebel-held areas.
Speaking to reporters during his tour, Ghebreyesus said that easing the U.S. sanctions on Syria within the next 180 days would give a window to bring more emergency supplies and support.
According to a UNHCR estimation, 5.3 million people in Syria might have been left homeless by the earthquake.

Syrians have to demolish falling homes for safety following earthquake,"ALEPPO, Syria, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- One of the saddest scenes one could ever see is the demolishing of his own home before his own eyes, especially after a devastating earthquake that deprived local residents of almost everything.
At the Nazlet Maysalound neighborhood in Aleppo and the nearby areas, the government safety committees have examined the seriously damaged buildings following the earthquake that rocked the country on Monday, and have decided to demolish eight buildings already.
On Saturday Xinhua team visited the site and witnessed the demolition of a cracked building.
Workers were knocking out some walls in the six-story building and opening holes in some corners to secure a smooth demolishing of the building.
A big bulldozer started knocking down some of the walls while workers started wrapping thick metal cords around some of the pillars to pull them back and make the building fall.
A hundred meters away, a cordon formed by military personnel and firefighters prevented people from inching close to the dangerous building. Residents, standing in pain, watching their memories and entire lifetime going down.
Jamil al-Muhammad, a man in his 20s, said that the second and fifth floors belonged to his family.
""We were sitting in peace when the earthquake hit, and we had to flee. Public Safety came and examined the building and marked the building as uninhabitable. So, it's being destroyed today,"" he lamented.
They survived the 11-year-long war, but the earthquake finally displaced them from their homes, he told Xinhua.
Now, al-Muhammad is staying with his parents and the rest of the family at a relative's house nearby.
His neighbor, a woman in her 50s, bitterly said that they were already impoverished by the nearly 12-year-long war, and they didn't know what to do to make a living after the earthquake.
""We have yet to receive any aid or help. We have yet to receive anything. Look at our situation. We got displaced, and we felt so cold. So, what is next?"" she said.
Most of these people said they wanted financial compensation to buy new homes, which is not easy for Syria as the country is going through a harsh economic situation amid economic sanctions imposed by the United States.
Thaer Rahhal, an engineer with the safety team, told Xinhua that there would be more buildings to be demolished due to the damage the earthquake had caused.
""Any cracked building that has a problem we destroyed it because this building would pose a risk to the area and people,"" he said.
The UN said the earthquake in Syria displaced 5.3 million people. More aid has reached Syria's quake victims but it's not enough.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said that the earthquake killed over 5,000 people in government and rebel-held areas in Syria.

Sanctions removal contradicts U.S. previous claims of not targeting humanitarian effort -- experts,"DAMASCUS, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. decision to lift sanctions on Syria in the wake of international condemnation contradicts what it has claimed, namely that the sanctions did not target humanitarian aid to the quake-hit country, Syrian experts have said.
The U.S. Treasury Department issued a six-month sanctions exemption for Syria-bound humanitarian aid on Thursday, three days after massive earthquakes and aftershocks struck TÃ¼rkiye and neighboring Syria that have left more than 24,000 dead and tens of thousands injured in both countries.
""The announcement of the U.S. Treasury is a confession that what Washington was claiming that the sanctions did not affect humanitarian aid was a false and misleading claim,"" political expert Muhammad al-Omari said.
Political expert Kamal al-Jafa said that if Washington's previous claims were legitimate and convincing, it would not have decided to lift the embargo.
""The United States knows that the sanctions imposed on the Syrian people were unjust and led to worsening the living conditions of the Syrians over the past few years,"" he said.
The Syrian government has repeatedly urged Washington to remove sanctions as they were unjust and inhumane, particularly after the strong earthquakes. On Tuesday, it lambasted the United States for blocking humanitarian relief work in Syria.
Sanctions have been a main U.S. tactic toward Syria ever since the latter was listed as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1979.
Since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, the United States and its Western allies have imposed a number of economic sanctions and restrictions that denied Syrians the means to pursue growth as well as access to daily necessities. U.S. sanctions intensified with the passing of the Caesar Act in 2019.

"China rushes rescue teams to quake-hit TÃ¼rkiye, Syria","BEIJING, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- China has offered an array of rescue teams and vital items to TÃ¼rkiye and Syria since massive earthquakes and aftershocks jolted the countries on Monday, in an effort to help search for survivors trapped under the rubble.
TÃ¼rkiye's disaster management agency updated the country's death toll late Friday from the earthquakes to 20,213, bringing the total fatalities with neighboring Syria to over 23,000, with tens of thousands injured.
International aid is pouring in amid ongoing rescue efforts.
Here's a look at the Chinese rescue teams performing rescue missions in TÃ¼rkiye and Syria:
An 82-member Chinese rescue team arrived at TÃ¼rkiye's Adana Sakirpasa Airport on Wednesday morning, carrying over 20 tons of equipment for rescue, communication and medical purposes, and four rescue dogs.
After driving for hours, the team arrived in the southern Turkish province of Hatay near the epicenter and carried out search and rescue operations in two areas as arranged by the local authorities.
Having saved a trapped pregnant woman on Thursday, the Chinese rescuers, with their Turkish colleagues, later pulled out two survivors from the ruins in Antakya, a city in Hatay.
On Friday, following a three-hour effort, a woman, the fourth survivor saved by Chinese rescuers, was pulled out to safety from the rubble of collapsed buildings over 96 hours after the earthquake.
The Chinese team was called to the scene after their Turkish counterparts discovered signs of life when clearing a heap of building ruins. During the operation, the team squeezed a flexible endoscope camera through small gaps in rubble to survey the condition beneath and worked with Turkish rescuers to demolish the surface of buried areas.
The Red Cross Society of China (RCSC) dispatched on Thursday morning a team of rescuers, with its first batch of medical supplies, to assist earthquake relief in war-torn Syria.
At the request of the Syrian Embassy and the Syrian Red Crescent, the RCSC sent supplies for up to 5,000 people.
Several civil Chinese rescue teams also joined the rescue efforts.
Eight earthquake relief experts from China's Rescue Team of Ramunion arrived in TÃ¼rkiye on Wednesday from the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, with more personnel from the rescue union expected to arrive in the coming days.
Captain of the team He Jun said that they would use advanced radar life detectors, demolition and rescue equipment and a search dog for the mission.
Members from the Blue Sky Rescue Team, a Chinese civil relief squad, started to assist rescue operations in Malatya province after their arrival on early Thursday, bringing search dogs, emergency items and other necessary resources.
After dozens of hours of working around the clock, an elder woman was successfully rescued by the civil relief squad.
The Amity Foundation, a Chinese non-governmental organization, also sent a team of around 60 members to TÃ¼rkiye.
The team carried out rescue work and provided aid for quake-affected people, such as distributing clothes and food, improving sanitation, etc.
As of Friday morning, 15 civil Chinese rescue teams comprising 288 personnel had made it to quake-hit regions in TÃ¼rkiye.
It has been 100 hours since the disaster occurred, and the local temperature remains low, casualty numbers are likely to rise as search-and-rescue efforts span a wide area of 10 Turkish provinces. Experts warned of dimmer chances of finding survivors 72 hours after the quakes.

Young people in the United States have little formal power to do anything about gun violence, it said, adding that decisions about how governments legislate guns and how communities and schools respond to shootings are primarily left to lawmakers, voters and law enforcement officials.
""Politicians should be more involved in the community,"" the report quoted Greg Novelo, a 20-year-old resident of Richmond, California, as saying. ""There's no progress to show that they're helping the community... they need activities, programs, parks you can go to that are safe,"" Novelo said.
Meanwhile, the report pointed out that law enforcement is not always the solution to gun violence in the United States. In some regions, ""police are a questionable solution to the problem of gun violence,"" it said.
Many students in South Los Angeles and the Bay Area described seeing police use force in their communities, which are disproportionately harmed by gun violence, rather than helping people find solutions to young people being involved in gangs and gun violence, the report said.

Lack of hygienic facilities endangers survivors in quake-hit TÃ¼rkiye,"ANTAKYA, TÃ¼rkiye, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Six days after the deadly twin earthquakes that killed nearly 30,000 in TÃ¼rkiye, the lack of hygienic facilities has started to endanger the survivors.
With thousands of buildings destroyed across the 10 quake-hit provinces in southern TÃ¼rkiye and many more unsafe to enter, the lack of lavatory facilities becomes one of the major issues.
""The issue of hygiene is becoming more and more urgent,"" wrote Ihsan Cakir, deputy general secretary of Hatay Municipality on Friday. The Hatay province was one of the worst hit areas by Monday's earthquakes.
""We need portable toilets,"" said Cakir, noting that volunteers and other personnel are now forced to go to neighboring cities to meet their needs.
Local media reported Sunday that 58 portable toilets and showers had been sent to the affected areas, while manufacturers around the country are gearing up to produce more.
In addition to toilets, access to clean water was just as urgent.

Greek FM visits TÃ¼rkiye in show of support after deadly quakes,"ANKARA, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias visited TÃ¼rkiye on Sunday in a show of support as massive earthquakes hitting the country have left more than 24,000 killed.
""We will continue to do our best to overcome difficult times, both at bilateral and the level of the European Union,"" Dendias said in a joint press statement with his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu in the quake-hit southern province of Hatay.

The visit by the Greek foreign minister comes amid long-standing tensions between the two NATO states over territorial disputes.
Both TÃ¼rkiye and Greece lie on seismic fault lines and have suffered several major earthquakes in the past decades.
""It's important to support each other in difficult times, but we don't have to wait for an earthquake or other disaster to fix our relationships. I hope we will make efforts to resolve our differences through dialogue,"" Cavusoglu said.
The Greek foreign minister agreed that the two countries do not need another earthquake to improve their relations.
On Monday, two deadly earthquakes measuring 7.7- and 7.6-magnitude struck 10 provinces in southern TÃ¼rkiye and the northern part of Syria.

Feature: Ethiopian immigration officers embrace Chinese language to better serve Chinese nationals,"ADDIS ABABA, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Teshager Moga described the communication barrier as the prime hurdle that he and fellow officers at the Foreigners' Service Directorate within the Ethiopian Immigration and Citizenship Service (ICS) often encounter in their day-to-day engagements with foreign nationals.
""Here, nationals of different foreign countries come on a daily basis for various issues concerning their stay in our country. Unfortunately, not all of them are able to interact with us through English or other Ethiopian languages,"" the ICS officer said.
Moga said the Chinese are one of the largest numbers of foreign nationals who come to the ICS to process their visa requirements and other needs. Despite their continued efforts to bridge the gaps in effectively addressing Chinese nationals, challenges emanating from the language barrier still persist.
On Saturday, Moga and 19 others who have been drawn from five directorates within the Ethiopian ICS embarked on a three-month basic Chinese language training program.
The short-term basic Chinese language training program, which will be offered by the Confucius Institute at Addis Ababa University, is expected to enable officers with basic Chinese language command.
Betelihem Hate, one of the 20 trainees, expressed her high expectations for the training in terms of enabling them to better Chinese language proficiency, eventually helping them to enhance their services to Chinese nationals.
""This is a very good and golden opportunity. Aware of the existing communication barrier the Ethiopian Immigration and Citizenship Service had previously hired a Chinese language translator to help facilitate our engagements with Chinese nationals. However, the demand still remains high,"" Hate said.
Moga also said the three-month training will not only enable him and fellow colleagues with basic Chinese language skills but also to better understand China and its people. ""I hope after this training we will be able to better interact and serve our Chinese friends, ultimately significantly improving our day-to-day service provision,"" Moga said.
General Director of the Ethiopian Immigration and Citizenship Service Bruhtesfa Mulugeta spoke highly of the training during the opening ceremony, as he urged the trainees to serve as connecting bridges between the people of the two countries.
""The support we get shows the collaboration between Ethiopia and the Chinese government and institutions. It will fulfill the gap our officers have, that is a communication gap to serve our customers,"" Mulugeta said. ""One of our honorable and known customers in our services are our Chinese brothers and sisters. In this regard, the language training given by the (Confucius) Institute is crucial to fulfilling the gap.""
Shen Qinmin, minister-counselor at the Chinese Embassy in Ethiopia, said cooperation in language education between the two countries cements the two countries' partnership across all sectors and serves as the mainstay of practical cooperation at all levels. He said empowering service providers, such as employees of the Ethiopian ICS, with better communication skills, will create conducive conditions in terms of improving Chinese nationals' experience in the East African country.
Che Zhaoguang, the cultural counselor at the Chinese Embassy in Ethiopia, also stressed the crucial role that language plays in connecting people toward a better future.
""A lot of Ethiopian students have graduated from the Confucius Institute and they can speak quite fluent Chinese and work in big Chinese companies. They are playing an important role in promoting the friendship and cultural relations between our two countries,"" he said.
Courtesy of the everblooming Sino-Ethiopian ties, the interest in studying the Chinese language is growing fast with newly opening institutes being operational across public universities in different parts of the East African country.
In addition to Addis Ababa University, Chinese language studies are now provided across different public universities throughout Ethiopia, including the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Institute, Bahir Dar University, Mekelle University, as well as Arsi University.
The Confucius Institute at the Addis Ababa University, which started operation in Ethiopia in 2012, has so far registered more than 10,000 students who passed through various levels of Chinese language studies at different facilities across the country, according to figures from the institute.
Addis Ababa University, with the help of the Confucius Institute, has also recently launched its first-ever Master of Arts (MA) program in the Chinese language in Ethiopia -- the Master of Teaching Chinese to Speakers of Other Languages (MTCSOL).

Germany plays key role in calming NATO partners,"BERLIN, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Although Germany was criticized by its partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) for its ""late"" export approval of Leopard tanks to Ukraine, the country is right not to blindly rush into more and more weapon deliveries and plays a key role in calming its western allies.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned against a ""public competition to outdo each other along the lines of battle tanks, submarines, aircraft..."" NATO must not become a party in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, he said ahead of a special meeting of the European Union (EU).
Amid this balancing act, the office of the German defense minister is considered the ""hot seat"" among ministerial posts. With his predecessor failing to finish the legislative term, the current Minister of Defense, Boris Pistorius, just took office last month.
REQUESTS FOR ARMS
Germany's new defense minister was appointed at a critical time when pressure from NATO partners to supply battle tanks to Ukraine was mounting. Only days after Pistorius took office, the government finally gave its green light for the tanks.
What once began with 5,000 helmets, Germany is now pledging to deliver 14 modern Leopard 2 tanks and gave permission to its allies, most notably Poland, to re-export Leopard tanks from their own stocks. The export of up to 178 of the older Leopard 1 tanks was also approved.
In view of the highly explosive political nature, it was Chancellor Scholz who announced the step. ""This decision follows on from our official line to support Ukraine to the best of our ability,"" said Scholz.
The United States followed suit, pledging 31 Abrams tanks. The West has thus crossed an invisible line that had long been avoided.
The West's military aid, Russia warned, would spark ""unpredictable"" escalation, dragging NATO members into the conflict. ""The United States and its allies are trying to prolong the conflict as much as possible,"" Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu said recently in a conference call with military officials.
Ukraine meanwhile is demanding more weapons and is asking for fighter jets as well. On Wednesday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated this in London during his second foreign visit since the beginning of the conflict.
Germany has so far opposed the delivery of fighter jets. Due to their greater range and firepower, ""we would be venturing into dimensions that I would currently warn against,"" Pistorius said in an interview with Sueddeutsche Zeitung in late January.
EMPTY STOCKS
Germany's ability to supply other nations with weapons is extremely limited due to the country's own undersupply. ""The shelves are almost empty,"" the Inspector General of the country's army found when taking stock last year.
Germany is far from meeting NATO's defense target of 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) per year, as promised by Scholz when presenting the special defense fund. According to the latest NATO estimates, the country's defense spending was only around 1.4 percent of GDP in 2022.
According to recent official remarks, it was unlikely that the country will meet the 2 percent target before 2025.
Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, Eva Hoegl, criticized the ""unacceptable"" lack of action to fully equip the German military at the end of last year. Almost 20 billion euros (21.4 billion U.S. dollars) would be required to stock up on ammunition alone.
Germany's current stockpile would not even last for a week in the event of a military conflict, she warned.
AVOIDING ESCALATION
Germany's internal struggles aside, Europe's largest economy has not entirely given up on the idea of a diplomatic solution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
Although most important decisions such as the delivery of tanks are well coordinated among western partners, the tone is different. While French President Emmanuel Macron is vowing to help Ukraine to ""victory"", Scholz is careful not to close all doors on Russia.
Ukrainians would be supported for ""as long as it is necessary,"" he said during the special EU meeting in Brussels on Friday. (1 euro = 1.07 U.S. dollar)

"Sri Lanka postpones non-essential, non-urgent surgeries at gov't hospitals","COLOMBO, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella on Sunday announced that all non-essential and non-urgent surgeries at government hospitals have been postponed.
He said that essential and urgent surgeries will be carried out without hindrance and that the measure is only temporary.
The decision comes in the wake of Sri Lanka Medical Association, the national professional medical association, warning that the health sector would face a serious crisis within a few weeks, if shortages of medicines, surgical equipment, and chemicals used in labs are not addressed now.
Sri Lanka has been facing a medical shortage since 2022 due to its balance of payment crisis, and the price of medicine has also gone up last year due to rising inflation.
Reports said that Sri Lanka relies on imports for about 85 percent of its pharmaceutical needs and about 80 percent of its medical supplies.

Philippine lawmaker pushes for Chinese language promotion in schools,"MANILA, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- To boost the competitiveness of Filipino workers in overseas labor markets, a Philippine lawmaker has pushed for the promotion of the Chinese language at all school levels.
""We already have the edge in foreign labor markets because our workers can speak English. We should now aspire to double that advantage by encouraging more Filipinos to learn Mandarin early,"" House of Representatives Minority Leader Marcelino Libanan said in a statement on Sunday.
He added that learning Chinese, the world's most widely spoken language, will open up new opportunities for Filipinos who wish to work or travel in China, and Chinese-speaking countries such as Singapore.
Libanan urged elementary and high schools to encourage the creation of Mandarin student clubs. ""We already have many young learners from Filipino-Chinese families that speak Mandarin. They can help put up Mandarin clubs in their schools,"" Libanan said.
Libanan also called on the country's state universities and colleges to offer Mandarin courses as part of their foreign language programs.

NICOSIA, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Former Foreign Minister Nicos Christodoulides won the runoff election on Sunday and will be the next president of Cyprus, Chief Returning Officer Costas Constantinou announced after the counting of all ballot papers.
Christodoulides, who ran as an independent received 51.97 percent of the votes, compared to 48.03 percent received by his opponent, Andreas Mavroyiannis, who also ran as an independent and had the support of the left-wing AKEL party.
Christodoulides will take office on March 1, to succeed Nicos Anastasiades, who already served two terms and couldn't seek re-election according to the law.

Christodoulides has served under Anastasiades as director of the Diplomatic Office of the President, as government spokesperson and foreign minister.
Election analyst Yiannis Mavris told CyBC television that the voters of the right-wing DISY party tilted the scale in favor of Christodoulides, despite the fact that he caused a rift in the party by running against its leader, Averof Neophytou. Christodoulides was a DISY official before submitting his candidacy.
Christodoulides invited DISY to take part in a ""general acceptance government"" he plans to announce, but the party declined the offer and said it would act as a ""responsible opposition.""
The new Cypriot president will be facing several pressing challenges, including restarting the deadlocked reunification negotiations, preventing increasing illegal immigration and solving labor disputes amid high inflation.
Presidential elections are held in Cyprus every five years.
The Chief Returning Officer said that 406,616 out of about 561,000 registers voters cast ballot in the runoff, which equals to about 72.5 percent turnout.

Local charities in Syria work at total capacity to serve quake-impacted people,"

ALEPPO, Syria, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- During the past painful week after the massive earthquake that hit the already war-torn country of Syria, local charities have been working at total capacity to help the people who are suffering from the deadly tremor.
The Saed Initiative is one of the charities working in Syria for years, with an aim to help people who were impacted by the 11-year war. Usually, they work during occasions such as the holy month of Ramadan, offering free iftar meals, but now they find themselves before a huge duty that could last for months.
Following the earthquake, the Saed Initiative decided to create a charity kitchen that would give free meals the entire year.
The group distributes between 2,500 to 4,000 meals per day in Aleppo, and they have plans to expand the capacity to distribute as many as 40,000 meals per day.
Isam Habbal, the head of Saed Initiative, told Xinhua at their charity kitchen in Aleppo that the Syrians have shown unmatched solidarity during this earthquake crisis as every house sent help to the people in need.
""This is a collective work that is giving service to our community. Indeed, our community shows what it's made of. At some point, before the relief planes arrived, every house sent help, whether from their clothes, medicines, or food and money,"" he said.
He said that Syrians ""proved to the world and ourselves, which is the most important, that we are all one, not separated by cities.""
At the kitchen, volunteers were working hard -- some chopping vegetables, others making rice, and many more packing food boxes into cars to be delivered to displacement shelters.

Habbal said that in Aleppo, his group has 150 volunteers working around the clock to secure meal parcels for the people.
At another place in Aleppo, another charity is providing food for the displaced people.
Eyad Abazid, a board member of the al-Bir and al-Ihsan charity, told Xinhua that local charities have shouldered the significant duty to help Syrian people regardless of the aid from outside the country.
He emphasized the importance of local charities in facing hardships, saying foreign humanitarian workers come and go. After all of this, people in the country remain together, so they must help each other.
Abazid said his charity distributes 1,500 meals every day.
""No matter how much foreign assistance we receive, we should be together because these are our families that have been affected. We have to maintain the momentum of helping each other,"" he said.
The UN said recently that the earthquake in Syria displaced 5.3 million people. The Syrian health ministry said the death toll of the earthquake victims rose to 1,414 dead and 2,349 wounded.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said the earthquake killed over 5,300 people in rebel-held and government areas in Syria, expecting the death toll to rise to as many as 7,000 people due to the number of people under the rubble.

STOCKHOLM, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Sweden has discarded nearly 8.5 million doses of vaccines against COVID-19, local media reported on Sunday.
The discarded doses equal to about 20 percent of vaccine doses Sweden has procured, according to Swedish Public Health Agency's statistics, Radio Sweden reported.
Richard Bergstrom, Sweden's former national vaccine coordinator, told Radio Sweden that the total value of the discarded doses was 1.5 billion Swedish kronor (143 million U.S. dollars).

The main reason for doses being discarded was the fact that individuals had not had their booster doses as expected, Bergstrom explained.
""The bulk is doses that people have chosen not to take, in other words, the third, fourth, or fifth (booster) dose. These were already purchased and now have to be destructed,"" said Bergstrom.
As of Thursday, 88.2 percent of all individuals aged 18 or over have received at least one dose, while 86.4 percent have received two doses or more, Swedish Public Health Agency's statistics show.
Addressing the global COVID-19 vaccine disparity already in 2021, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that six times more COVID-19 boosters were administered a day globally than primary doses in low-income countries. Countries with the highest vaccine coverage ""continue to stockpile more vaccines,"" while ""low-income countries continue to wait"" for the shots -- ""a scandal that must stop now.""

"Deepening relations with China ""the only reasonable choice"" for Europe, says French expert","
French scholar Bruno Guigue is pictured at his home in France's overseas island La Reunion, Sept. 23, 2022. (Xinhua)
Amid the energy crisis and soaring inflation, Europe needs even closer cooperation with China, Guigue said. ""Whether in terms of trade, technology advances, or grand infrastructure projects, it (China) will have to be reckoned with.""
PARIS, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- ""The reality should teach the Europeans that, by following the United States, they are not defending their own interests,"" French international affairs expert Bruno Guigue has said, noting that deepening relations with China is ""the only reasonable choice"" of Europe.
Certain American politicians insist that the United States should ""decouple"" from China, it is because Washington's foreign policy is dominated by the geopolitical anxiety of the American leaders over China's success, Guigue told Xinhua in a recent interview.
""Instead of following the Americans' policy, the Europeans should therefore free themselves from it... For Europe, the only reasonable choice is to deepen its political, economic, and cultural relations with China,"" he stressed.
For Guigue, China will not only become a leading power of the world, but also a peaceful power with whom Europe will gain advantages by cooperating with it.
The contamination of Europe by Washington's unilateralism has ""unfortunately"" created an unprecedented situation, he said.
""But this (American) privilege will not last forever. The crisis in Ukraine has deepened the distrust of many countries towards Washington after the illegal seizure of Russia's assets,"" he noted.

Guigue stressed that ""China is not a danger to the Europeans, it is not a threat hanging over their heads, and it is not a 'systemic rival'.""
China's participation ""with success"" in global economic competition does not seek to oust anyone nor to impose its own policies on other countries, he noted.
In 2022, trade between China and Europe reached an all-time high of 847 billion U.S. dollars. ""The Europeans intend to rebalance these exchanges, it is understandable, but it is not by closing Europe to Chinese exports that they will achieve this,"" Guigue told Xinhua.
Worked as a senior official in the French Ministry of the Interior from 1990 to 2008, Guigue pointed out that France and China have forged fruitful partnerships in many sectors, such as nuclear industry, aeronautics, and public health.
Amid the energy crisis and soaring inflation, Europe needs even closer cooperation with China, Guigue said. ""Whether in terms of trade, technology advances, or grand infrastructure projects, it (China) will have to be reckoned with.""
""Why should Europe stay away from the planetary-scale transformations led by the Chinese companies, by their international dynamism, and by their astonishing capacity for innovation?"" he wrote.
""When a country achieves economic success, you must first try to understand why it succeeds, and then try to cooperate with it to profit from it. Those who advocate distancing themselves from China are doing the opposite: they refuse to understand this country and adopt, in principle, a negative posture. In fact, they bury their heads in the sand,"" Guigue said.

ANKARA/DAMASCUS, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from the twin earthquakes that rocked Trkiye and Syria on Feb. 6 has climbed to 29,605 and 1,414 respectively as of Sunday evening.
The number of wounded, meanwhile, rose to over 80,000 in Trkiye and 2,349 in Syria, according to official figures.
FAULTY CONSTRUCTION
Trkiye has issued arrest warrants for 134 suspects involved in the faulty construction of buildings that collapsed in the earthquakes, Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said on Sunday.
Three of the suspects were arrested, Bozdag told reporters.
The catastrophic earthquakes have flattened more than 20,000 buildings across the 10 quake-affected regions.
Yavuz Karakus and Sevilay Karakus, contractors of many buildings destroyed in the earthquake in southern Adiyaman province, were detained at Istanbul Airport while trying to escape to Georgia, the local NTV broadcaster reported on Sunday.
Two more people were arrested for cutting the column of a building that collapsed in Gaziantep province, the semi-official Anadolu Agency reported.
RESCUE CONTINUES
Thousands of rescuers continued to search for any sign of life in collapsed multi-storey buildings on the seventh day of the disaster. Hopes for finding alive survivors are fading, but the teams still manage some incredible rescues.
Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca posted a video of a girl child rescued at the 150th hour. ""Rescued a little while ago by crews. There is always hope!"" he tweeted on Sunday.
Rescue workers pulled out 65-years old women in the Antakya district of Hatay province 160 hours after the quake, the Anadolu Agency reported.
A survivor was rescued from the debris in the Antakya district of Hatay province by Chinese and local rescuers on Sunday afternoon, 150 hours after the quake hit the region.
INT'L AID &SUPPORT
The first batch of emergency aid, including tents and blankets, delivered by the Chinese government for earthquake relief has arrived in Trkiye on Saturday.
In the coming days, more emergency supplies, including tents, electrocardiographs, ultrasonic diagnostic equipment and medical transfer vehicles will be shipped in batches from China.
Syria is also receiving supplies from the Red Cross Society of China and the local Chinese community.
The aid from the local Chinese community included infant formulas, winter clothes, and medical supplies, while the first batch of emergency medical supplies from the Red Cross Society of China was sent to the country on Thursday.
On Sunday, Algeria and Libya also sent planes full of relief items to the quake-hit areas.
Meanwhile, foreign heads of state and ministers started to pay visits to Trkiye and Syria for showing solidarity.
Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias visited Trkiye on Sunday in a show of support. ""We will continue to do our best to overcome difficult times, both at bilateral and the level of the European Union,"" said Dendias, the first European foreign minister visiting Trkiye after the disaster.
The visit by the Greek foreign minister comes amid long-standing tensions between the two NATO states over territorial disputes.
The Qatari emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the first foreign head of a state visiting quake-hit Trkiye, met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Istanbul on Sunday.
Qatar has sent the first part of the 10,000 container houses for earthquake victims in Trkiye, the Anadolu Agency reported.
Also on Sunday, Foreign Minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan visited Syria, promising continuing support for the country to overcome the repercussions of the catastrophic earthquake, Syrian state news agency SANA reported.

"U.S. unilateral sanctions, dollar hegemony compound woes of Mideast countries","CAIRO, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- Having been ravaged for years by wars and sanctions, Syria is now being battered again by catastrophic earthquakes on Monday, shattering the dreams of thousands who had hoped for a better life in 2023.
In the face of heavy casualties in Syria, the United States, bowing to international pressure, announced on Thursday a temporary easing of sanctions on the war-torn country. Yet the compromise came too late for too many, whose lives have perished under the rubble while waiting for the much-needed relief aid blocked by the United States.

The tragedy is yet another testament to the U.S. misconduct in the region, which has for years fallen victim to wars, sanctions and inflation ""exported"" by Washington.
UNILATERAL SANCTIONS
The U.S. decision to lift sanctions on Syria in the wake of international condemnation contradicts what it has claimed, namely that the sanctions did not target humanitarian aid to the quake-hit country, according to Syrian political experts.
""The United States knows that the sanctions imposed on the Syrian people were unjust and led to worsening the living conditions of the Syrians over the past few years,"" said political expert Kamal al-Jafa.
By maintaining the airspace's closure and blocking the entry of any medical or relief equipment to the area, the U.S. sanctions have prevented any effort to help the affected area's residents, said Mazen Shamieh, former assistant minister for the Palestinian Foreign Ministry.
Prior to the earthquakes, 90 percent of Syrians live in poverty. In the war-torn country, parents are skipping meals so their children can eat; electricity and fuel are scarcer than ever; many are increasingly unable to access clean water and health care or even to communicate with loved ones or colleagues, because of connectivity outages and failing infrastructure, said UN Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen in December.
Salem Abu Al-Oyoun, a displaced Syrian who moved from Aleppo to Al-Wazani camp in southeastern Lebanon, believed that the decision of the U.S. treasury to remove sanctions is a big lie that does not serve the people who have suffered from the unjust U.S. siege.
Tawfiq Abu Salwan from Idlib, another refugee who moved to the town of Hasbaya in southern Lebanon, said that the U.S. lifting of part of the sanctions is a desperate attempt to improve and polish its global image. ""It will not have any effect on the ground in our country, Syria, and we consider it as non-existent.""
WORST INFLATION
The earthquakes came at a time when life was already hard enough for the people in the Middle East. The double-digit inflation in the region has choked many who have already been struggling to feed themselves.
Fuelling their economic woes, many scholars said, is the irresponsible monetary policy of the United States, whose eight consecutive interest rate hikes have disrupted the world economy and dampened the outlook of an economic recovery.
In TÃ¼rkiye, the rising consumer price inflation hit a 24-year high of 85.5 percent in October.

In Lebanon, food prices skyrocketed 143 percent between September and December in 2022, ranking third in food price inflation in the world, according to a World Bank statement.
In Egypt, whose currency has lost half of its value from a year ago, the prices of rice and some vegetables have doubled over the course of a few months last year.
The price of chicken in January 2023 rose to 72.26 Egyptian pounds (2.39 U.S. dollars) per kilo, a staggering 230-percent increase from 2013. The price of bread witnessed a 460-percent hike in the same period, with 10 loaves of unsubsidized bread now costing 14 Egyptian pounds, up from 2.5 pounds in 2013.
Sameer Mousa, a retired veteran living in Amman, the capital of Jordan, said he has not brought fruit home for two months.
""The prices are soaring all over the world, but people living in other countries with better salaries can live well. Our salaries are low, even not enough for paying house rent, electricity bills, or water bills,"" he complained.
The picture is much the same in Tunisia, where local residents find it difficult even to get a packet of milk. The shortage of dairy products in Tunisia resulted from the rising price of fodder, which forced many local cow breeders to sell their livestock.

Youssef Meriah, a 52-year-old cow farmer, used to keep 10 dairy cows and more than 40 sheep in Sidi Thabet, northwest of the capital Tunis. Now he has sold a third of his herd due to the high price of hay.
""I, just like many other farmers across the country, was forced to sell our cows as economic conditions worsen,"" he said.
U.S. DOLLAR'S DOMINANCE
Jomai Gasmi, a Tunisian political and economic analyst, said the soaring inflation in his country was closely related to the interest rate hikes of the Federal Reserve of the United States.
""If you compare the timetable, you can see that the inflation in Tunisia suddenly increased after the Fed hikes,"" Gasmi said, referring to the U.S. Fed's moves of raising the dollar's interest rate.
""It also forced the central bank of Tunisia to raise the interest rate. The last surprise rate rise was on Jan. 14, and the central bank's benchmark rate now stands at 8 percent,"" Gasmi said.
It is impossible for countries like Tunisia and Egypt not to take the Fed's monetary policies into account when making choices because of the dollar's hegemonic status, said Waleed Gaballah, a professor of financial and economic jurisdictions at the Cairo University in Egypt.
""The U.S. dollar becomes a more attractive and safer haven for investors after the rises of the interest rate,"" said Gaballah, noting that since March 2022, a total of 25 billion U.S. dollars of indirect investment in the local debt instruments existed in the Egyptian market.

A man passes a foreign exchange office in Cairo, Egypt, Dec. 25, 2022. (Xinhua/Ahmed Gomaa)
""When fleeing Egypt, foreign investors needed to buy U.S. dollars, causing a drop in Egyptian pound value,"" he explained.
With the U.S. dollar as the world's leading reserve currency, the United States could use the dollar's overwhelming might to transfer its crisis to the rest of the world, regardless of the repeated warnings by economists that the hikes will disrupt the world economy and foreshadow a recession.
Gasmi said that it is ""disappointing and infuriating that the U.S. is exporting inflation for its own benefit and making the world pay for it.""
The dollar's strength has also increased the debt-repayment burdens and deepened poverty in many developing countries, such as Lebanon which is being pushed to the verge of national bankruptcy, Gasmi added.
DE-DOLLARIZATION MOMENTUM
Adnan Bourji, director of the Lebanese National Center for Studies, said it is such a shame that the Middle East region, with its natural resources and strategic location, should suffer inflation that has been spiraling out of control.
Solutions are possible if the dependence on the West and its deadly directives are abandoned, said Bourji, adding that right now the United States and other Western countries still have the upper hand in forming some of the governments in the region and imposing directives to serve its goals.
Gaballah said it is ""not logical for Egypt's central bank to continue raising the interest rate and follow the U.S. Federal Reserve.""
He called for a ""de-dollarization"" approach to limit U.S. irresponsible loosening or tightening of monetary policy in favor of its own interest.
To hedge against the risk of falling into Washington's financial trap, more countries are embarking on the de-dollarization process, exploring ways to circumvent the U.S. currency.
India, for example, is discussing plans with the United Arab Emirates to settle bilateral transactions in their local currencies. The central banks of South Korea and Australia also extended their currency swap agreement by five years to 2028.
As the de-dollarization is gathering momentum, Michael Hudson, a professor of economics at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, noted that putting an alternative monetary system in place will take time.
""The whole structure will change and there's still going to be many countries using the dollar. But the dollar will just be like other countries' (currencies). It will have to pay its own way,"" Hudson said. ""It can't just issue dollar debt without pressure.""

"Facts about TÃ¼rkiye, Syria quake: Death toll tops 28,000, int'l aid pour in","ANKARA/DAMASCUS, Feb. 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are the latest facts about quake-hit TÃ¼rkiye and Syria.
-- COMBINED CASUALTIES
Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay announced late Saturday that the country's death toll from Monday's earthquakes has climbed to 24,617, bringing the total fatalities with neighboring Syria to over 28,000, with tens of thousands injured.
-- RESCUE EFFORTS
Search and rescue efforts in 10 quake-hit provinces of TÃ¼rkiye have now begun to turn to debris removal on the sixth day of the disaster. Rescue teams from across TÃ¼rkiye and around the world were still trying to find survivors in the rubble of toppled buildings and pulled them out against all odds. However, with casualties soaring, few were pulled out of the rubble on Saturday.
Chinese rescuers have successfully rescued at least four survivors so far. An 82-member Chinese rescue team arrived in TÃ¼rkiye on Wednesday to join earthquake relief efforts in the country. Members of the Blue Sky Rescue Team and other Chinese civil relief squads were also in TÃ¼rkiye to join the international rescue work.
At least 160,000 people, including foreign teams, were on the field for search and rescue efforts, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Saturday.
An Armenian delegation with five trucks of aid has entered TÃ¼rkiye through the Alican Border Gate in the eastern province of Igdir, which opened for the first time in 30 years, the state-run Anadolu News Agency of TÃ¼rkiye reported Saturday.
The World Health Organization (WHO) brought 35 tons of relief aid to the quake-hit Aleppo city in northern Syria on Saturday as WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus reached the city and visited some hospitalized people, shelters where displaced people are staying, and damaged areas.
-- PROBLEMS &RESPONSE
In a statement, the Turkish Medical Association warned about infectious diseases that may occur after the earthquake. Damage to infrastructure such as electricity, water, and sewerage increases the risk of water- and food-borne diseases, the statement said.
Addressing the criticism that the quake response was not swift enough, Erdogan said it was impossible to get prepared for a calamity like the earthquakes that struck the country on Monday.
Speaking to reporters during his Syria tour, Ghebreyesus said that easing the U.S. sanctions on Syria within the next 180 days would give a window to bring more emergency supplies and support.
On Thursday, the U.S. Treasury Department issued a so-called six-month sanctions exemption for Syria-bound humanitarian aid, saying the U.S. sanctions in Syria ""will not stand in the way"" of life-saving efforts.

As audio and sonar detectors were used to search for signs of life, all equipment ceased operation. A hush fell over the noisy site. This was the quietest moment I've experienced these days. Everyone on site held their breath, waiting for miracles to happen.
We don't believe in tears. We believe in miracles!
As of the evening of Feb. 11, the Rescue Team of Ramunion has located 17 buried individuals, including 7 survivors, across four cities in TÃ¼rkiye's Hatay Province. With the team's assistance, local rescue forces were able to locate 14 additional sites where more trapped individuals may be present.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- While U.S. President Joe Biden often claims he is laser-focused on combatting inflation, his policies as shown in the latest State of the Union address say otherwise, according to a recent report by The Hill.
The report, published on Friday, gave three reasons.
Firstly, there was little suggestion in Biden's address that exorbitant federal spending would come down any time soon. Besides, the president's proposed Buy American program will drive infrastructure costs higher.
What's more, Biden's ongoing dedication to unionization would lead to higher labor costs; his war on fossil fuels has discouraged higher oil and gas production, and the Federal Reserve will ""have its hands full bringing inflation down to 2 percent,"" said the report.
It also pointed out that Biden's address was ""peppered with expensive new promises."" For example, he continues to advocate forgiving certain student loans, and is demanding ""family medical leave"" and ""affordable child care."" But, ""who pays for that?"" the report asked.

JERUSALEM, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli border police officer on Monday was ""critically"" wounded in East Jerusalem in a suspected stabbing attack perpetrated by a 13-year-old Palestinian and then by ""friendly fire,"" Israeli authorities said.
According to a police statement, the Palestinian teenager used a kitchen knife to stab the 20-year-old police officer inside a bus outside a checkpoint in the Shuafat refugee camp in East Jerusalem.
An Israeli security guard opened fire at the perpetrator and apparently hit the officer by accident.
Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said in a statement that the officer was taken to a hospital and was in ""a critical condition.""
The Palestinian boy was ""neutralized,"" the police said. The Hebrew-language Ha'aretz newspaper later reported that he was arrested.
The incident came hours after a 14-year-old Palestinian boy stabbed and lightly injured a 17-year-old Israeli in East Jerusalem's Old City.
The incidents took place amid a surge of violence in the region and a day after Israeli airstrikes hit the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian coastal enclave. The military said in a statement that the attack targeted an underground complex containing raw materials used for the manufacturing of rockets belonging to Hamas, an armed Palestinian group that runs Gaza. It was carried out as ""a response"" to earlier rocket attacks from Gaza, the army said.
