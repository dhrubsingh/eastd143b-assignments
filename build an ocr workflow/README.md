This contains code for the building an OCR workflow. The code to be run can be run by executing *ocr.py*. In order to run this, you must use Streamlit to run the file by running the following command on your computer: *python3 -m streamlit run ocr.py*. Once this loads onto localhost, you can drag and drop files into the OCR workflow page, and can select either English, Spanish, or French OCR models. Clicking "Process Images" will parse through the image, and then "Save as CSV" will save the parsed results to your local directory where the code is running.

Notes about Tesseract: in order to run the above, you also must also ensure that you have Tesseract installed on your computer. To run the Spanish and French OCR models, I learned, you have to manually downlaod some of the trained data for these languages to feed into OCR. It doesn't just come out of the box out from initial installation. You can retrieve these files form this link: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata
